The purpose of the scripts in this directory is to make it possible to copy files from Chassis to Alfresco using the unique file id

Note some of these files are very similar to those in the parent directory but not the same

Usage:
Place the file ids into 'files-to-copy.txt' - one per line
Edit config.sh to have the right passwords

Run get-files.sh
Run alf-upload-files.sh
