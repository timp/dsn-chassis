<h2 id="L55">1. Introduction</h2>

<h3 id="Scope">1.1. Scope of Chassis/WWARN</h3>

<h4 id="WWARN">1.1.1. WWARN Data Management</h4>

<p>The <em>Chassis/WWARN</em> system is intended to support the <strong>data
management activities</strong> of the WWARN data-sharing network. These data
management activities include the <strong>submission</strong> of data,
<strong>curation</strong> of submitted data to meet quality control and other
(e.g., ethical) criteria as defined by WWARN, and <strong>mapping</strong> of
submitted data onto WWARN standard data dictionaries. </p>

<p>The end goal of these data management activities is to produce data that is
suitable for ingest into and publication by The WWARN Application.</p>

<h4 id="Chassis">1.1.2. Chassis/WWARN and The WWARN Application</h4>

<p>Note that the <em>Chassis/WWARN</em> system is distinct from <em>The WWARN
Application</em>. The WWARN Application is a separate system, intended to
support the visualisation, analysis, sharing and publication of standardised
data. </p>

<p>This specification assumes that data will be periodically exported from the
Chassis/WWARN system and ingested into The WWARN Application. Management of
this export and ingest process is out of scope for the Chassis/WWARN system,
and will be specified elsewhere. Requirements for The WWARN Application,
including all requirements for data visualisation and analysis tools, are not
in scope for this document, and are specified elsewhere.</p>

<h4 id="First">1.1.3. First Major Release (1.0)</h4>

<p>This document specifies mandatory requirements ("must-haves") for the first
major release (1.0) of the Chassis/WWARN system for production use by WWARN.
</p>

<p>The goal of the 1.0 release of Chassis/WWARN is to provide a system that
supports the <strong>bare minimum</strong> needed to enable WWARN to begin
accepting and curating data submissions. I.e., a system that is just sufficient
to enable WWARN to establish key operating procedures and begin basic data
management activities, and that can therefore be delivered as soon as possible.
The functionality of the 1.0 release (as specified here) should therefore be
limited to those features that are deemed <strong>absolutely necessary</strong>
to enable the basic data management operations of WWARN to commence.</p>

<p>Subsequent releases of Chassis/WWARN will then provide additional
functionality as needed. Specifying this additional functionality is not in
scope for this document, however, some features that might be developed for
future releases of Chassis/WWARN are briefly discussed.</p>

<p>The aim for the Chassis/WWARN 1.0 release is to coincide with the first
WWARN milestone, which is scheduled for Q1 (Jan) 2010. However, because this
document is in flux, and requirements may be added or removed, it is not
possible to provide a precise release date at this stage. The informatics team
will, however, provide access to working prototypes as often as possible on the
way towards the 1.0 release, so the rest of the consortium can evaluate
functionality and progress.</p>

<h4 id="L614">1.1.4. Limited Release for WHO Data Submission (0.1)</h4>

<p>Note that a limited functionality release (0.1) of Chassis/WWARN, enabling
submission of data using the WHO spreadsheet format only, is also planned. The
requirements for Chassis/WWARN (0.1) will be specified in a separate document,
however, they are expected to form a subset of the requirements specified here.
</p>

<h4 id="L1241">1.1.5. Managing User Accounts</h4>

<p>This document assumes that management of user accounts, user roles, and
authentication for the Chassis/WWARN system will be handled via the CGGH user
account database and single sign-on system. This document therefore does not
include any functionality for managing user accounts, assigning roles to users,
or authenticating users (i.e., logging in and out of the system).</p>

<h3 id="L632">1.2. About This Document</h3>

<h4 id="L641">1.2.1. Intended Audience</h4>

<p>This document is an internal draft, intended for discussion within the WWARN
consortium. It is meant to provide a concise description of the functionality
provided by Chassis/WWARN 1.0. It is not intended for end-users of the
Chassis/WWARN system.</p>

<h4 id="L655">1.2.2. Working Draft</h4>

<p>This document is a working draft, and is intended to act as a focus for
discussion within the WWARN consortium. Feedback is very welcome, and may be
sent via email to informatics@wwarn.org.</p>

<p>Where there may be several possible choices relating to a particular
requirement, some discussion is included in the document below, in the <a
href="@@TODO LINK">Discussion &amp; Open Questions</a> section.</p>

<h4 id="L1887">1.2.3. Chassis/*</h4>

<p>This user requirements specification is scoped to the requirements of the
WWARN data-sharing network. However, note that the Chassis/WWARN system is
intended to be the first instance of a generic platform (Chassis/*), which can
be customised to support the data management activities of other, similar,
data-sharing networks. Therefore, this specification aims to describe
requirements in a generic way, wherever possible, using terminology that is
transferable to other data-sharing networks. </p>

<h4 id="L719">1.2.4. Structure of This Document</h4>

<p>@@TODO</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="L840">2. Workflow - Summary of Key Points</h2>

<p>This section summarises the key points of the data management workflow that
Chassis/WWARN will be designed to support. </p>

<p>This section does not cover all requirements in detail. See the section
below on use cases and functional requirements for detailed coverage of these
points.</p>

<h3 id="L870">2.1. Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h3>

<p>The following roles are defined here for users of the Chassis/WWARN
system.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <strong>user</strong> is anyone who is authorized to access the
    Chassis/WWARN system.</li>
  <li>A <strong>submitter</strong> is a user who can create a data submission.
    A submitter represents and is assumed to act for the people and/or
    organisations who have intellectual property rights and copyright over any
    data they submit.</li>
  <li>A <strong>gatekeeper</strong> is a user with the authority to accept a
    data submission for curation. By accepting a submission, the gatekeeper is
    asserting that the submission is relevant to WWARN, and authorising the
    expenditure of resources (i.e., time and effort) on curating the
  submission.</li>
  <li>A <strong>curator</strong> is a user who will perform curation
    activities, which might include (but are not limited to) reviewing
    submitted data, revising submitted data, ensuring that data meet quality
    control criteria and conform to standard data dictionaries.</li>
  <li>A <strong>coordinator</strong> is a user who has overall responsibility
    for the operations of a data-sharing network.</li>
  <li>An <strong>administrator</strong> is a user with the authority to
    configure the Chassis/WWARN system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the same user may hold more than one of the above roles.</p>

<h3 id="L1386">2.2. Data Submission Workflow</h3>

<h4 id="L310">2.2.1. Creating Submissions</h4>

<p>Data submission is the process whereby new data enters the Chassis/WWARN
system.</p>

<p>A submitter initiates the process by <strong>creating a new
submission</strong>. Creating a submission involves providing a title and
textual summary for the submission, linking the submission to at least one
study (see below), and linking the submission to at least one WWARN module. The
submitter then uploads a data file containing the initial version of the
submitted data. </p>

<h4>Submission Ownership, Permissions and Privacy</h4>

<p>When a new submission is created, the submitter who created it becomes the
sole <strong>owner</strong> of that submission. The submission owner can the
grant ownership to other submitters. All owners will have the same permissions
with respect to the submission as the initial owner.</p>

<p>When a new submission is created, it is initially in a
<strong>draft</strong> state. It is also private to its owner(s), and is not
visible to any other users of the system.</p>

<h4 id="L353">2.2.2. Creating Studies</h4>

<p>When a submitter is creating a new submission, they must link the new
submission to at least one study.</p>

<p>Before creating the first submission for a study, a submitter will have to
create a record for the study. Creating a study involves providing at a title
and textual summary for the study, and linking the new study to at least one
WWARN module.</p>

<p>Once a study has been created, the submitter can then proceed to enter
further metadata about the study (i.e., to fill out the study site
questionnaire). However, to provide the minimum obstacle to the submitter, it
is <strong>not</strong> necessary that any further study metadata be entered
before a submitter can begin creating new submissions linked to the study, or
request gatekeeper review for those submissions. (A gatekeeper could, on the
other hand, require that some or all of the study site questionnaire be
completed before a submission can be accepted for curation, i.e., completing
some or all of the SSQ could form part of the gatekeeper's acceptance criteria,
see below.)</p>

<h4>Study Ownership, Permissions and Privacy</h4>

<p>When a new study is created, the submitter who created becomes the sole
<strong>owner</strong> of that study. The study owner can the grant ownership
to other submitters. All owners will have the same permissions with respect to
the study as the initial owner.</p>

<p>The owner(s) of a study can also authorise other submitters to create
submissions linked to that study. </p>

<p>To enable other submitters to find studies previously created by other
submitters, and avoid creation of duplicate records for the same study, some
limited information for <strong>all</strong> studies will be visible to
<strong>all</strong> users of the system. This limited information consists of
the study title, textual summary, and owner(s). All other details of the study,
including the SSQ, will remain private and visible only to the study owner(s).
</p>

<p>In order to present the minimum obstacle to the submitter, the system will
allow <strong>any</strong> submitter to create a submission and link it to
<strong>any</strong> study, even if they are
<strong></strong><strong>not</strong> an owner of that study, and even if they
have <strong>not</strong> been authorised to link submissions to that study by
the study owner(s). In this case, the owner(s) of the study will be notified
that the new submission has been linked to the study by an as-yet unauthorised
submitter, and will be given the opportunity to grant the necessary
authorisation to the submitter. (Note also that a gatekeeper could require that
the submitter has the appropriate authorisation beforing accepting a submission
for curation, i.e., being an owner or authorized submitter for the study or
studies to which a submission is linked could form part of the gatekeeper's
acceptance criteria, see below.)</p>

<h4>Submitted Data</h4>

<p>The first step after creating a submission is to upload a single data file
containing the initial version of the submitted data. </p>

<p>Note that Chassis/WWARN (1.0) does <strong>not</strong> place any
constraints on the nature or format of the data file uploaded as submitted
data. The Chassis/WWARN (1.0) system will not attempt to parse the submitted
data file, and will not provide any previews of the submitted data. Later
versions of Chassis/WWARN may provide support for parsing and previewing of
some data files, e.g., where data files conform to a standard data dictionary,
or where data files contain a single table of data in a spreadsheet format.</p>

<h4 id="L1452">2.2.3. Data Dictionaries</h4>

<p>Submitted data must be linked to a data dictionary, before a submission can
be reviewed by a gatekeeper and accepted for curation (see also below). A data
dictionary defines the structure (i.e., layout, format) and semantics (i.e.,
meaning) of submitted data.</p>

<p>Creating a data dictionary involves providing a title and textual summary
for the dictionary, linking the dictionary to at least one WWARN module, and
uploading a file containing the initial version of the dictionary.</p>

<p>It is expected that a data dictionary will <strong>at least</strong> provide
a list of the field or variable names used in the data, and a textual
definition of each field. Ideally, the dictionary would also specify the
datatype of each field (e.g., integer, decimal, text), the units of the field
(e.g., g/dl), and any constraints on the range of values for that field (e.g.,
numeric range constraints for a field with a numeric datatype, or controlled
vocabulary constraints for a field with a text datatype). </p>

<p>Note, however, that Chassis/WWARN (1.0) does <strong>not</strong> place any
restrictions on the nature or format of the data dictionary file uploaded when
a new data dictionary is created or revised. The system will not attempt to
parse the data dictionary file, nor provide any preview of its contents. Later
versions of Chassis/WWARN may constrain the content and layout of data
dictionary files, and parse files to store and provide views of data
dictionaries. Later versions of the system may also provide online support for
creating and editing the contents of data dictionaries, without needing to
upload files. See also the <a href="@@TODO">discussion of data dictionaries</a>
below.</p>

<h4>Data Dictionary Ownership, Privacy and Sharing</h4>

<p>When a new dictionary is created, the submitter who created it becomes the
sole <strong>owner</strong> of that dictionary. The dictionary owner can then
grant ownership to other submitters. All owners will have the same permissions
with respect to the dictionary as the initial owner, including the ability to
revise the dictionary.</p>

<p>By default, all dictionaries will be visible to all users. However, </p>

<p>To enable other submitters to find studies previously created by other
submitters, and avoid creation of duplicate records for the same study, some
limited information for <strong>all</strong> studies will be visible to
<strong>all</strong> users of the system. This limited information consists of
the study title, textual summary, and owner(s). All other details of the study,
including the SSQ, will remain private and visible only to the study owner(s).
</p>

<p>@@TODO privacy and sharing of dictionaries A submitter can create a new data
dictionary for each new submission, or re-use an existing data dictionary
created by themselves or someone else. </p>

<p></p>

<h4 id="L1494">2.2.4. Gatekeeper Review</h4>

<p>Before a submission can progress beyond the draft state and be
<strong>accepted for curation</strong>, it must first be reviewed by a
gatekeeper. </p>

<p>When a submitter has finished preparing their submission, they can
<strong>request a gatekeeper review</strong> of the submission. Until that
point, the submission is in a draft state, and is private to the submission
owner(s). Once the request has been made for gatekeeper review, a gatekeeper
will be assigned to review the submission. The assigned gatekeeper may then
view the details of the submission and the submitted data.</p>

<p>The gatekeeper is responsible for performing an initial evaluation of the
submitted data and accompanying data dictionary, to determine whether or not
resources (i.e., time and effort) should be spent curating the data, and with
what priority. </p>

<p>The gatekeeper is <strong>not</strong> responsible for making any
modifications to the data or approving the data for release to The WWARN
Application. </p>

<p>The outcome of a gatekeeper review is either to accept the submission for
curation, or not to accept the submission for curation. Once a gatekeeper has
accepted a submission, they can assign a curator to the submission.
Responsibility for the submission then passes from the gatekeeper to the
assigned curator.</p>

<p>There may be more than one gatekeeper. For Chassis/WWARN, it is anticipated
that submissions will be assigned to a gatekeeper based on the WWARN module(s)
to which the submission is linked by its submitter.</p>

<p>The criteria that the gatekeeper use to decide whether or not to accept a
submission are referred to here as <strong>acceptance criteria</strong>. Each
module may have different acceptance criteria. A module may also have no
acceptance criteria, i.e., may accept all submissions by default. </p>

<p>A gatekeeper may also assign a priority to an accepted submission.</p>

<h4 id="L1677">2.2.5. Revising Submissions</h4>

<p>Before a submitter has requested gatekeeper review of a submission, they can
make revisions to the submitted data. A submitter can also make revisions after
a submission is accepted. </p>

<p>If a submission is not accepted, a submitter can revise a submission after
the gatekeeper's review, and make a new request for gatekeeper review of the
revised submission. </p>

<h4 id="L925">2.2.6. Constraints on Data and Data Dictionaries</h4>

<h3 id="L363">2.3. Data Curation &amp; Standardisation Workflow</h3>

<h4 id="L365">2.3.1. General Points</h4>

<p>The curation process takes submitted data as input and produces data that is
suitable for <strong>release</strong> to The WWARN Application, and hence made
available for visualisation, analysis, sharing and publication.</p>

<p>The curation process comprises a wide and open-ended range of possible
activities. However, in general, curation activities are either
<strong>revision activities</strong>, which involve revising the submitted data
in some way (e.g., adding, removing, or restructuring data), or <strong>review
activities</strong>, where the submitted data are reviewed with respect to some
criteria (e.g., ethical criteria, quality control criteria) and an assertion is
made that the data either do or do not meet those criteria.</p>

<h4 id="L508">2.3.2. Transformation and Mapping to WWARN Standard Data
Dictionaries</h4>

<p>In addition to the non-standard data dictionaries that submitters can
create, the Chassis/WWARN system has one or more data dictionaries managed by
the curators that are agreed <strong>WWARN standard data dictionaries</strong>.
WWARN standard data dictionaries are like any other data dictionaries, in that
they define expectations for the structure and semantics of submitted data,
except that they are maintained by the curators.</p>

<p>A special type of revision activity involves transforming data that is
submitted in a non-standard form into something that conforms with one of the
standard data dictionaries. Defining such a transformation is also referred to
here as "mapping". However, note that just because data conforms to the
structural and semantic conditions of a standard data dictionary, does not
necessarily mean that the data are reliable or make any sense. I.e., quality
control is a separate concern from mapping submitted data to standard data
dictionaries (see also below). </p>

<p>In the Chassis/WWARN 1.0 release, no support will be provided for
transforming data. I.e., it is assumed that all data will be transformed using
other systems, e.g., off-line desktop tools. Later versions of Chassis/WWARN
may provide online support for defining and executing mappings between data
conforming to different data dictionaries.</p>

<h4 id="L791">2.3.3. Validation</h4>

<p>A special type of review activity involves checking that submitted data
conform with respect to a given data dictionary, also referred to here as
"validation". The Chassis/WWARN 1.0 release will not provide any support for
validation. I.e., it is assumed that validation will be performed using other
systems, e.g., by manual review, or using off-line desktop tools. Later
versions of Chassis/WWARN may provide some online support for validation, where
possible. </p>

<h4 id="L427">2.3.4. Release Criteria</h4>

<p>A submission cannot be released to The WWARN Application unless the
submitted data conforms to one of the WWARN standard data dictionaries.
Therefore, the minimum curation activity for a submission is to check that the
submitted data conforms to a WWARN standard data dictionary, and if not, to
transform the data into something that does.</p>

<p>In addition to checking that submitted data conform to one of the WWARN
standard data dictionaries, the curators may also define additional
<strong>release criteria</strong> for submissions, which might include, e.g.,
ethical and/or quality control criteria. The curators may then review any
submission with respect to some release criteria, and assert whether or not the
submitted data are approved with respect to those release criteria.</p>

<p>The curators may define <strong>more than one</strong> set of release
criteria, e.g., to represent different degrees of confidence in the submitted
data. The Chassis/WWARN system will expose information about which submissions
have been approved by the curators with respect to which set of release
criteria to The WWARN Application, which will enable users of The WWARN
Application to filter data in visualisations and analyses by different sets of
release criteria.</p>

<p>Each WWARN module may also define and maintain its own sets of release
criteria.</p>

<h4 id="L451">2.3.5. Sharing and Publication</h4>

<p>@@TODO sharing and publication mechanisms for submissions</p>

<h4 id="Curation">2.3.6. Curation and Collaboration</h4>

<p>@@TODO something about control over which curator(s) can submit revisions to
a submission.</p>

<h4 id="L455">2.3.7. Ordering of Curation Activities</h4>

<p>The Chassis/WWARN system does not prescribe the order in which data are
mapped to a standard data dictionary and revised to meet quality control
standards and other release criteria. I.e., data may be submitted in a
non-standard form, revised to meet quality control standards, and then mapped
to a standard data dictionary; or data may be first mapped to a standard data
dictionary, and then revised to meet quality control criteria; or revisions to
address quality issues may be applied both before and after mapping to a
standard data dictionary.</p>

<h4 id="L938">2.3.8. Provenance and Derivation of Data</h4>

<p>A key design goal for Chassis/WWARN is that the complete and true derivation
of any data released to The WWARN Application must be recorded. By derivation,
we mean the complete sequence of actions and revisions that led from the data
as initially submitted to the data in its released form, i.e., its
provenance.</p>

<p>A curator can upload revisions of submitted data. To ensure that the true
derivation of any data revision is captured, the curator must explicitly assert
the derivation of any new revision they make, i.e., they must select the
version of the data (either submitter version or another curator version) that
was taken as input to the curator's new revision. This also ensures that
curators can go back and do work on versions of the submitted data other than
the latest version, and an accurate audit trail of their activities will still
be maintained. (I.e., for any one submission, the curators' revisions to the
submitted data are assumed to form an arbitrarily branching tree, where the
root of each tree is one of the submitter's revisions.)</p>

<p>A submitter can upload a revision of submitted data at any time. To keep
things simple for a submitter, they do not have to assert the derivation of
each new revision. (I.e., for any one submission, the submitter's revisions of
the submitted data are assumed to form a single linear version series.) </p>

<h3 id="L1833">3.1. Constraints on Data Dictionaries</h3>

<p>This document tentatively takes the position that, for the first major
release of Chassis/WWARN, there will be no constraints on the structure or
content of data dictionaries. Data dictionaries are simply uploaded as files of
any type, with any content. This position was taken because the complete range
of possible submitted data structures is not currently known, and therefore it
may be useful in the early stages of WWARN to enable some flexibility as the
consortium encounters new data and works towards a common approach to data
dictionaries.</p>

<p>However, the goal for later releases of Chassis/WWARN is to support a single
type of data dictionary, with the content of the data dictionary managed
through a web interface, rather than through the upload of files. Based on
previous experience in CGGH, the likely approach would be that each such data
dictionary would define a set of variables (also known as fields or
attributes), where each variable has a unique identifier, a human-readable
label, a human-readable definition of the variable's meaning, a datatype for
the variable, the units of the variable, and any range constraints (e.g.,
numeric constraints or controlled vocabulary) on the values the variable may
take. This would enable further functionality, such as an analysis of the
diversity of variable names used across all data submitted, which can support
the process of convergence on a common set of data standards across the
consortium. It would also be possible in some cases to use the data dictionary
to drive automated functionality such as simple validation of datatypes and
data ranges. It would also provide a basis for developing functionality to
define and execute mappings (i.e., transformations) between data conforming to
different data dictionaries, which is planned for future releases of
Chassis/WWARN.</p>

<p>Placing no constraints on the content or structure of data dictionaries, in
the first major release of Chassis/WWARN, may however have a number of
undesirable consequences. Firstly, many submitters may not have prior
experience of constructing data dictionaries, and may not know what information
to provide or how to provide it. Without clear guidance and examples, both the
quality (usefulness), the structure and the content of data dictionaries
created by submitters may be highly variable. Whilst prominent guidance and
examples may ameliorate some of these issues, there is no guarantee on
consistency or convergence towards a common approach to constructing data
dictionaries. Secondly, without any constraints on data dictionaries, it will
not be possible to reliably parse or analyse all data dictionaries, or to use
the data dictionary to support any automated functionality such as simple
validation of datatypes and data ranges. Thirdly, once a common approach to
data dictionaries is agreed and supported in Chassis/WWARN, there would be a
legacy of previously created dictionaries in a variety of formats to migrate,
which would require some effort.</p>

<p>Whether or not the first major release of Chassis/WWARN enforces a single
approach to data dictionaries, or is more flexible and places no constraints on
files uploaded as data dictionaries, is therefore an important open question in
this specification. </p>

<ul>
  <li>What happens if, for a given submission, the submitter uploads several
    files that are not revisions of each other, but are separate parts of a
    data set that is meant to be combined? </li>
