Static mockup:

  * http://dsn-chassis.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wwarn/prototype/war/prototype.html

The mockup design is based on the UI model sketched in the following images. In the sketches below, "entry point" does not mean a GWT entry point, rather it means a page/view that can be reached via one step from the user's home page.
