	<h3>Terms of Submission</h3>
	
	<p>The Terms of Submission is a simple agreement between you – the data contributor – and WWARN. In this short document, we ask you to confirm a few facts about the data and how it was collected. This is to ensure that WWARN meets the ethical and legal responsibilities we assume when accepting data. In return, WWARN sets out the measures we will take to secure contributed data and assure that you remain in control of the use of your data.
