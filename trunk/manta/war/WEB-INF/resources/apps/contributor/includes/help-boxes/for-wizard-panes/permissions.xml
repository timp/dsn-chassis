<p>You have control over who can access your studies. You may want to delegate the task of uploading data to a particular member of your team or share the task amongst several individuals. In addition, you may want to share your data with a collaborator.
</p>
	<p>To share study data with an individual, you will need to name them as an administrator. An administrator has all the same rights as you — the study creator — including uploading data, downloading anonymised data, adding/removing administrators and editing information about the study.
	</p>
		<p>An administrator must be a registered user of the WWARN website to access study information. Your administrators will only be able to access your study once it has been registered. 
		</p>
			<p>You can add or remove administrators at any time by logging into the WWARN website, navigating to this study in the Data home and clicking the Permissions tab.
