	<p>Research is a group effort. You may want to delegate the task of uploading data to a particular member of your team or share the task amongst several individuals. You may want to share your data with a collaborator. You have control over who can access your studies. 
	</p>

	<p>To share a study with an individual, you will need to add them as an administrator. Administrators will have all the same rights as you — the study creator — including uploading data, downloading anonymized data, adding/removing administrators and editing all the information about the study. 
	</p>
	
	<p>Administrators will only be able to access the study once it has been registered and will need to register with the WWARN website.
	</p>
	
	<p>You can add or remove administrators at any time by logging into your account, navigating to this study and clicking the Permissions tab.
