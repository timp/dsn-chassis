	<p>Whenever possible, we ask that you upload three types of files for each study: data file(s), a data dictionary and the associated study protocol(s). 
	</p>
	<p>If you don&#8217;t have these files available at this time, you can complete the study registration by moving on to Step 5. You or an administrator can add files at a later date by logging into the WWARN website, navigating to this study in the Data home and clicking the Files tab.
