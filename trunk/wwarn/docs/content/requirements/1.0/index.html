<div id="bd">
<h2 id="L55">1. Introduction</h2>

<h3 id="Scope">1.1. Scope of Chassis/WWARN</h3>

<h4 id="WWARN">1.1.1. WWARN Data Management</h4>

<p>The <em>Chassis/WWARN</em> system is intended to support the <strong>data
management activities</strong> of the WWARN data-sharing network. These data
management activities include the <strong>submission</strong> of data,
<strong>curation</strong> of submitted data to meet quality control and other
(e.g., ethical) criteria as defined by WWARN, and <strong>mapping</strong> of
submitted data onto WWARN standard data dictionaries. </p>

<p>The end goal of these data management activities is to produce data that is
suitable for visualisation, analysis and publication by The WWARN
Application.</p>

<h4 id="Chassis">1.1.2. Chassis/WWARN and The WWARN Application</h4>

<p>Note that the <em>Chassis/WWARN</em> system is distinct from <em>The WWARN
Application</em> (current prototype at <a
href="https://www.wwarn.org/warnapp/datamap/datamap.html">https://www.wwarn.org/warnapp/datamap/datamap.html</a>).
The WWARN Application is a <strong>separate system</strong>, intended to
support the visualisation, analysis, aggregation, sharing and publication of
standardised data. </p>

<p>This specification assumes that data will be periodically exported from the
Chassis/WWARN system and ingested into The WWARN Application. Management of
this export and ingest process is out of scope for the Chassis/WWARN system,
and will be specified elsewhere. Requirements for The WWARN Application,
including all requirements for data visualisation, aggregation and analysis
tools, are not in scope for this document, and are specified elsewhere.</p>

<h4 id="First">1.1.3. First Major Release (1.0)</h4>

<p>This document specifies mandatory requirements ("must-haves") for the first
major release (1.0) of the Chassis/WWARN system for production use by WWARN.
</p>

<p>The goal of the 1.0 release of Chassis/WWARN is to provide a system that
supports the <strong>bare minimum</strong> needed to enable WWARN to begin
accepting and curating data submissions. I.e., a system that is just sufficient
to enable WWARN to establish key operating procedures and begin basic data
management activities, and that can therefore be delivered as soon as possible.
The functionality of the 1.0 release (as specified here) should therefore be
limited to those features that are deemed <strong>absolutely necessary</strong>
to enable the basic data management operations of WWARN to commence.</p>

<p>Subsequent releases of Chassis/WWARN will then provide additional
functionality as needed. Specifying this additional functionality is not in
scope for this document, however, some features that might be developed for
future releases of Chassis/WWARN are briefly discussed.</p>

<p>The aim for the Chassis/WWARN 1.0 release is to coincide with the first
WWARN milestone, which is scheduled for Q1 (Jan) 2010. However, because this
document is in flux, and requirements may be added or removed, it is not
possible to provide a precise release date at this stage. The informatics team
will, however, provide access to working prototypes as often as possible on the
way towards the 1.0 release, so the rest of the consortium can evaluate
functionality and progress.</p>

<p>Note that, as this document currently stands, it is quite likely that the
set of requirements is more than can be realistically be achieved by Q1 2010.
Once the consortium has achieved some consensus on the key points of the data
submission and curation workflows, it is suggested that we attempt to reduce
and/or prioritise the functional requirements given below. </p>

<h4 id="L614">1.1.4. Limited Release for WHO Data Submission (0.1)</h4>

<p>Note that a limited functionality release (0.1) of Chassis/WWARN, enabling
submission of data using the WHO spreadsheet format only, is also planned. The
requirements for Chassis/WWARN (0.1) will be specified in a separate document,
however, they are expected to form a subset of the requirements specified here.
</p>

<h4 id="L1241">1.1.5. Managing User Accounts</h4>

<p>This document assumes that management of user accounts, user roles, and
authentication for the Chassis/WWARN system will be handled via the CGGH user
account database and single sign-on system. This document therefore does not
include any functionality for managing user accounts, assigning roles to users,
or authenticating users (i.e., logging in and out of the system).</p>

<h3 id="L632">1.2. About This Document</h3>

<h4 id="L641">1.2.1. Intended Audience</h4>

<p>This document is an internal draft, intended for discussion within the WWARN
consortium. It is meant to provide a concise description of the functionality
provided by Chassis/WWARN 1.0. It is not intended for end-users of the
Chassis/WWARN system.</p>

<h4 id="L655">1.2.2. Working Draft</h4>

<p>This document is a working draft, and is intended to act as a focus for
discussion within the WWARN consortium. Feedback is very welcome, and may be
sent via email to <a
href="mailto:informatics@wwarn.org?subject=Chassis/WWARN requirements draft 6">informatics@wwarn.org</a>.</p>

<p>Where there may be several possible choices relating to a particular
requirement, some discussion is included in the document below, in the <a
href="@@TODO LINK">Discussion &amp; Open Questions</a> section.</p>

<h4 id="L3059">1.2.3. Study Metadata (Study Site Questionnaire)</h4>

<p>This document does <strong>not</strong> include a specification of the
metadata fields that are to be included in the study site questionnaire for the
Chassis/WWARN 1.0 release. It is suggested that a separate document be created
to specify the SSQ for the Chassis/WWARN 1.0 release.</p>

<h4 id="L1887">1.2.4. Chassis/*</h4>

<p>This user requirements specification is scoped to the requirements of the
WWARN data-sharing network. However, note that the Chassis/WWARN system is
intended to be the first instance of a generic platform (Chassis/*), which can
be customised to support the data management activities of other, similar,
data-sharing networks. Therefore, this specification aims to describe
requirements in a generic way, wherever possible, using terminology that is
transferable to other data-sharing networks. </p>

<h4 id="L719">1.2.5. Structure of This Document</h4>

<p><a href="#L840">Section 2 (Workflow)</a> summarises the key points of the
workflow that the Chassis/WWARN system will be designed to support. It provides
a summary of the vision for the Chassis/WWARN system.</p>

<p><a href="#L584">Section 3 (Use Cases)</a> provides a more detailed
illustration of some of the main features of the Chassis/WWARN system and
underlying workflow.</p>

<p><a href="#L679">Section 4 (Functional Requirements)</a> breaks the workflow
and use cases down into a set of functional requirements, which will be used by
the development team to plan &amp; prioritise.</p>

<p><a href="#L1824">Section 5 (Discussion)</a> provides some information on
discussion points and open issues.</p>

<h2 id="L840">2. Workflow - Summary of Key Points</h2>

<p>This section summarises the key points of the data management workflow that
Chassis/WWARN will be designed to support. </p>

<p>This section does <strong>not</strong> cover all requirements in detail. See
the section below on use cases and functional requirements for detailed
coverage of these points.</p>

<h3 id="L870">2.1. Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h3>

<p>The following roles are defined here for users of the Chassis/WWARN
system.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <strong>user</strong> is anyone who is authorized to access the
    Chassis/WWARN system.</li>
  <li>A <strong>submitter</strong> is a user who can create a data submission.
    A submitter represents and is assumed to act for the people and/or
    organisations who have intellectual property rights and copyright over any
    data they submit.</li>
  <li>A <strong>gatekeeper</strong> is a user with the authority to accept a
    data submission for curation. By accepting a submission, the gatekeeper is
    asserting that the submission is relevant to WWARN, and authorising the
    expenditure of resources (i.e., time and effort) on curating the
  submission.</li>
  <li>A <strong>curator</strong> is a user who will perform curation
    activities, which might include (but are not limited to) reviewing
    submitted data, revising submitted data, ensuring that data meet quality
    control criteria and conform to standard data dictionaries.</li>
  <li>A <strong>coordinator</strong> is a user who has responsibility for
    managing/coordinating some or all of the operations of a data-sharing
    network.</li>
  <li>An <strong>administrator</strong> is a user with the authority to
    configure the Chassis/WWARN system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the same person may hold more than one of the above roles.</p>

<h3 id="L1386">2.2. Data Submission Workflow</h3>

<h4 id="L310">2.2.1. Creating Submissions</h4>

<p>Data submission is the process whereby new data enters the Chassis/WWARN
system.</p>

<p>A submitter initiates the process by <strong>creating a new
submission</strong>. Creating a submission involves providing a title and
textual summary for the submission, linking the submission to at least one
study (see below), and linking the submission to at least one WWARN module. The
submitter then uploads a data file containing the initial version of the
submitted data. </p>

<h4 id="L369">2.2.2. Submission Ownership, Permissions and Privacy</h4>

<p>When a new submission is created, the submitter who created it becomes the
sole <strong>owner</strong> of that submission. If the submission owner wishes
to work with another submitter to prepare the submission, the submission owner
can <strong>grant ownership</strong> to other submitters. All owners will have
the same permissions with respect to the submission as the initial owner, for
example, they will all be able to edit the submission title and summary, and
upload revisions to the submitted data (see below).</p>

<p>When a new submission is created, it is initially in a
<strong>draft</strong> state. It is also private to its owner(s), and is not
visible to any other users of the system.</p>

<h4 id="L353">2.2.3. Creating Studies</h4>

<p>When a submitter is creating a new submission, they must link the new
submission to at least one study.</p>

<p>Before creating the first submission for a study, where there is no previous
record of the study in the Chassis/WWARN system, a submitter will have to
create a record for the study. Creating a study involves providing at a title
and textual summary for the study, and linking the new study to at least one
WWARN module.</p>

<p>Once a study has been created, the submitter can then proceed to enter
further metadata about the study (i.e., to fill out the study site
questionnaire). However, to present the minimum obstacle to users, it is
<strong>not</strong> necessary that any further study metadata be entered
before a submitter can begin creating new submissions linked to the study, or
request gatekeeper review for those submissions. </p>

<p>(Note that a gatekeeper could, on the other hand, require that some or all
of the study site questionnaire be completed before a submission can be
accepted for curation, i.e., completing some or all of the SSQ could form part
of the gatekeeper's acceptance criteria, see below.)</p>

<h4 id="L392">2.2.4. Study Ownership, Permissions and Privacy</h4>

<p>When a new study is created, the submitter who created it becomes the sole
<strong>owner</strong> of that study. The study owner can also grant ownership
to other submitters. All owners will have the same permissions with respect to
the study as the initial owner, for example, they will be able to edit the
study site questionnaire. </p>

<p>The owner(s) of a study can choose to make the study
<strong>visible</strong>, in which case any user of the system will be able to
find the study and view all details of the study site questionnaire, or
<strong>discoverable</strong>, in which case any user of the system will be
able to find the study and view its title and summary but will
<strong>not</strong> be able to view any other information about the study, or
<strong>private</strong>, in which case only the study owner(s) and authorised
submitters will be able to find it and view its details.</p>

<p>If the study owners are aware that several submitters will be creating
submissions linked to this study, then the owners can <strong>grant submission
authority</strong> for that study to one or more other submitters.</p>

<p>However, in order to present the minimum obstacle to users, the system will
allow <strong>any</strong> submitter to link their submissions to
<strong>any</strong> visible or discoverable study, even if they are
<strong></strong><strong>not</strong> an owner of that study, and even if they
have <strong>not</strong> been granted submission authority by the study
owner(s). In this case, the owner(s) of the study will be notified that the new
submission has been linked to the study by an as-yet unauthorised submitter,
and will be given the opportunity to grant submission authority to the
submitter. </p>

<p>(Note also that a gatekeeper could require that the submitter has the
appropriate authorisation from the study owner(s) beforing accepting a
submission for curation, i.e., being an owner or authorized submitter for the
study or studies to which a submission is linked could form part of the
gatekeeper's acceptance criteria, see also below.)</p>

<h4 id="L426">2.2.5. Submitted Data</h4>

<p>The first step after creating a submission is to upload a single data file
containing the initial version of the submitted data. </p>

<p>Note that Chassis/WWARN (1.0) does <strong>not</strong> place any
constraints on the nature or format of the data file uploaded as submitted
data. The Chassis/WWARN (1.0) system will not attempt to parse the submitted
data file, and will not provide any previews of the submitted data. Later
versions of Chassis/WWARN may provide support for parsing and previewing of
some data files, e.g., where data files conform to a standard data dictionary,
or where data files contain a single table of data in a spreadsheet format.</p>

<h4 id="L1452">2.2.6. Data Dictionaries</h4>

<p>The Chassis/WWARN system requires that submitted data must be linked to a
data dictionary, before a submission can be reviewed by a gatekeeper and
accepted for curation (see also below). </p>

<p>Creating a data dictionary involves providing a title and textual summary
for the dictionary, linking the dictionary to at least one WWARN module, and
uploading a file containing the initial version of the dictionary.</p>

<p>A data dictionary defines the structure (i.e., layout, format) and semantics
(i.e., meaning) of submitted data. It is expected that a data dictionary will
<strong>at least</strong> provide a list of the field or variable names used in
the data, and a textual definition of each field. Ideally, the dictionary would
also specify the datatype of each field (e.g., integer, decimal, text, etc.),
the units of the field (e.g., g/dl), and any constraints on the range of values
for that field (e.g., numeric range constraints for a field with a numeric
datatype, or controlled vocabulary constraints for a field with a text
datatype). </p>

<p>Note, however, that Chassis/WWARN (1.0) does <strong>not</strong> place any
restrictions on the nature or format of the data dictionary file uploaded when
a new data dictionary is created or revised. The system will not attempt to
parse the data dictionary file, nor provide any preview of its contents. Later
versions of Chassis/WWARN may constrain the content and layout of data
dictionary files, and parse files to store and provide views of data
dictionaries. Later versions of the system may also provide online support for
creating and editing the contents of data dictionaries, without needing to
upload files. See also the <a href="@@TODO">discussion of data dictionaries</a>
below.</p>

<h4 id="L454">2.2.7. Data Dictionary Ownership, Privacy and Sharing</h4>

<p>When a new dictionary is created, the submitter who created it becomes the
sole <strong>owner</strong> of that dictionary. The dictionary owner can then
grant ownership to other submitters. All owners will have the same permissions
with respect to the dictionary as the initial owner, for example, the ability
to revise the dictionary.</p>

<p>The owner(s) of a dictionary can choose to make the dictionary
<strong>visible</strong>, in which case any user of the system will be able to
find and view the dictionary, or <strong>discoverable</strong>, in which case
any user of the system will be able to find the dictionary and view its title
and summary but will not be able to view the content of the dictionary, or
<strong>private</strong>, in which case only the dictionary owner(s) and
authorised submitters will be able to find it and view its content.</p>

<p>A submitter can create a new data dictionary for each new submission, or
re-use an existing data dictionary created by themselves, or re-use a
dictionary created by someone else. In order to present the minimum obstacle to
users, the system will allow <strong>any</strong> submitter to link their
submitted data to <strong>any</strong> visible or discoverable dictionary. See
also <a href="#L1960">discussion of dictionaries and privacy</a> below.</p>

<h4 id="L1494">2.2.8. Gatekeeper Review</h4>

<p>Before a submission can progress beyond the draft state and be
<strong>accepted for curation</strong>, it must first be reviewed by a
gatekeeper. </p>

<p>When a submission owner has finished preparing their submission, they can
<strong>request a gatekeeper review</strong> of the submission. Until that
point, the submission is in a draft state, and is private to the submission
owner(s). Once the request has been made for gatekeeper review, a gatekeeper
will be assigned to review the submission. The assigned gatekeeper may then
view the details of the submission, the submitted data, the associated data
dictionary, and the study(ies) to which the submission is linked.</p>

<p>The gatekeeper is responsible for performing an initial evaluation of the
submitted data and accompanying data dictionary, to determine whether or not
resources (i.e., time and effort) should be spent curating the data, and with
what priority. The gatekeeper is <strong>not</strong> responsible for making
any modifications to the data or approving the data for release to The WWARN
Application. </p>

<p>The outcome of a gatekeeper review is either to accept the submission for
curation, or not to accept the submission for curation. Once a gatekeeper has
accepted a submission, they can assign a curator to the submission.
Responsibility for the submission then passes from the gatekeeper to the
assigned curator.</p>

<p>There may be more than one gatekeeper. For Chassis/WWARN, it is anticipated
that each WWARN module will have its own gatekeeper(s), and that submissions
will be assigned to a gatekeeper based on the module(s) to which the submission
is linked by its submitter.</p>

<p>The criteria that the gatekeeper use to decide whether or not to accept a
submission are referred to here as <strong>acceptance criteria</strong>. Each
module may have different acceptance criteria. A module may also have no
acceptance criteria, i.e., may accept all submissions by default. </p>

<p>A gatekeeper may also assign a priority to an accepted submission.</p>

<h4 id="L1677">2.2.9. Revising Submissions</h4>

<p>Before a submitter has requested gatekeeper review of a submission, they can
upload revisions to the submitted data. A submitter can also make revisions
after a submission is accepted for curation. </p>

<p>If a submission is not accepted, a submitter can revise a submission after
the gatekeeper's review, and make a new request for gatekeeper review of the
revised submission. </p>

<h3 id="L363">2.3. Data Curation Workflow</h3>

<h4 id="L365">2.3.1. Curation Overview</h4>

<p>The curation process takes submitted data as input and produces data that is
suitable for <strong>release</strong> to The WWARN Application, and hence made
available for visualisation, analysis, aggregation, sharing and publication.</p>

<p>The curation process comprises a wide and open-ended range of possible
activities. However, in general, curation activities are either
<strong>revision activities</strong>, which involve revising the submitted data
in some way (e.g., adding, removing, or restructuring data), or <strong>review
activities</strong>, where the submitted data are reviewed with respect to some
criteria (e.g., ethical criteria, quality control criteria).</p>

<h4 id="L815">2.3.2. Revision Activities</h4>

<p>Revision activities are curation activities which involve revising the
submitted data in some way, e.g., adding, removing or restructuring the data,
for any reason.</p>

<p>Note that the Chassis/WWARN 1.0 system will <strong>not</strong> provide any
on-line support for revising submitted data. It is assumed that all revision
activities will be achieved by downloading a chosen version of the submitted
data to work on, making the necessary changes using other tools, e.g., off-line
desktop tools, then uploading the revised version of the submitted data to the
Chassis/WWARN system. See also the <a href="#L938">note on derivation and
provenance</a> below.</p>

<h4 id="L508">2.3.3. Transformation and Mapping to WWARN Standard Data
Dictionaries</h4>

<p>In addition to the non-standard data dictionaries that submitters can
create, the Chassis/WWARN system has one or more data dictionaries managed by
the curators that are agreed <strong>WWARN standard data dictionaries</strong>.
WWARN standard data dictionaries are like any other data dictionaries, in that
they define expectations for the structure and semantics of submitted data,
except that they are maintained by the curators.</p>

<p>A special type of revision activity involves transforming data that is
submitted in a non-standard form into something that conforms with one of the
standard data dictionaries. Defining such a transformation is also referred to
here as "mapping". </p>

<p>In the Chassis/WWARN 1.0 release, no support will be provided for mapping
and transforming data. I.e., it is assumed that all data will be transformed
using other systems, e.g., off-line desktop tools. Later versions of
Chassis/WWARN may provide online support for defining and executing mappings
between data conforming to different data dictionaries.</p>

<h4 id="L838">2.3.4. Review Activities</h4>

<p>Review activities are curation activities where submitted data are reviewed
with respect to some criteria, e.g., ethical or quality control criteria, and
an assertion is made that the data either do or do not meet those criteria.</p>

<h4 id="L791">2.3.5. Validation</h4>

<p>A special type of review activity involves checking that submitted data
conform with respect to a given data dictionary, also referred to here as
"validation". </p>

<p>Note that the Chassis/WWARN 1.0 release will <strong>not</strong> provide
any support for validation. I.e., it is assumed that validation will be
performed using other systems, e.g., by manual review, or using off-line
desktop tools. Later versions of Chassis/WWARN may provide some online support
for validation, where possible. </p>

<p>Note that, just because data conforms to the structural and semantic
conditions of a standard data dictionary, does not necessarily mean that the
data are reliable or make any sense. I.e., quality control is a separate
concern from mapping submitted data to standard data dictionaries (see also
below). </p>

<h4 id="L427">2.3.6. Release Criteria</h4>

<p>A submission cannot be released to The WWARN Application unless the
submitted data conforms to one of the WWARN standard data dictionaries.
Therefore, the minimum curation activity for a submission is to check that the
submitted data conforms to a WWARN standard data dictionary, and if not, to
transform the data into something that does.</p>

<p>In addition to checking that submitted data conform to one of the WWARN
standard data dictionaries, the curators may also define additional
<strong>release criteria</strong> for submissions, which might include, e.g.,
ethical and/or quality control criteria. In order to make those criteria
explicit, the curators may document them in a <strong>release criteria
specification</strong>. The Chassis/WWARN system will provide support for
creating and revising release criteria specifications.</p>

<p>The curators may then review any submission, with respect to a given release
criteria specification, and assert whether or not the submitted data are
<strong>approved</strong> with respect to those release criteria.</p>

<p>The curators may define <strong>more than one</strong> release criteria
specification, e.g., to represent different degrees of confidence in the
submitted data. The Chassis/WWARN system will expose information about which
submissions have been approved by the curators with respect to which release
criteria specification to The WWARN Application, which will enable users of The
WWARN Application to filter data in visualisations and analyses by different
release criteria.</p>

<p>Release criteria specifications will also be versioned, to enable criteria
to be modified or updated without confusing the status of previously reviewed
data.</p>

<p>Each WWARN module may also define and maintain its own release criteria
specifications.</p>

<h4 id="L451">2.3.7. Making Studies and Submissions Public</h4>

<p>All submissions are, by default, <strong>private</strong>, which means they
are visible only to their owner(s), and to the Chassis/WWARN gatekeepers and
curators. It is anticipated that submissions which are private, but where the
submitted data conforms to a standard data dictionary, <strong>will</strong> be
made available for analysis and visualisation by The WWARN Application
(although possibly not the initial release of The WWARN Application), but that
The WWARN Application will at all times respect the privacy constraints that
are defined within the Chassis/WWARN system. I.e., in the case of private
submissions, only the submission's owners will be able to view visualisations
and analyses of data from their submission, and the data will
<strong>not</strong> be included in any public aggregations.</p>

<p>A submission's owner(s) may choose to make their submission
<strong>public</strong> at any time. Where a submission has been made public,
and where the submitted data conforms to a standard data dictionary, it is
assumed that the data will then be consumed and made publicly available by The
WWARN Application, and included in public visualisations, aggregations and
analyses.</p>

<p>A submission can only be made public if at least one of the studies to which
the submission is linked has also been made public. If a study has been made
public, then it is assumed that some details of the study will appear in the
public areas of The WWARN Application.</p>

<h4 id="L744">2.3.8. Curation and Collaboration</h4>

<p>See the <a href="#Curation">discussion of curation and collaboration</a>
below.</p>

<h4 id="L455">2.3.9. Ordering of Curation Activities</h4>

<p>The Chassis/WWARN system does not prescribe the order in which data are
mapped to a standard data dictionary and revised to meet quality control
standards and other release criteria. I.e., data may be submitted in a
non-standard form, revised to meet quality control standards, and then mapped
to a standard data dictionary; or data may be first mapped to a standard data
dictionary, and then revised to meet quality control criteria; or revisions to
address quality issues may be applied both before and after mapping to a
standard data dictionary.</p>

<h4 id="L938">2.3.10. Provenance and Derivation of Data</h4>

<p>A key design goal for Chassis/WWARN is that the complete and true
<strong>derivation</strong> of any data released to The WWARN Application must
be recorded. By derivation, we mean the complete sequence of events and
revisions that led from the data as initially submitted to the data in its
released form, i.e., its <strong>provenance</strong>.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, a curator can upload revisions of submitted data for any
curation they are working on. To ensure that the true derivation of any data
revision is captured, the curator must explicitly assert the derivation of any
new revision they make, i.e., they must select the version of the data (either
submitter version or another curator version) that was taken as input to the
curator's new revision. This also ensures that curators can go back and do work
on versions of the submitted data other than the latest version, and an
accurate audit trail of their activities will still be maintained. (I.e., for
any one submission, the curators' revisions to the submitted data are assumed
to form an arbitrarily branching tree, where the root of each tree is one of
the submitter's revisions.)</p>

<p>A submission owner can also upload a revision of the submitted data at any
time. To keep things simple for a submitter, they do not have to assert the
derivation of each new revision. (I.e., for any one submission, the submitter's
revisions of the submitted data are assumed to form a single linear version
series.) </p>

<h2 id="L584">3. Use Cases</h2>

<p>The use cases below provide a more detailed illustration of how a user will
interact with the Chassis/WWARN (1.0) system, in the most commonly anticipated
situations. The use cases are <strong>not</strong> exhaustive, i.e., are not
intended to cover all aspects of the system functionality.</p>

<h3 id="L591">3.1. Data Submission Use Cases</h3>

<h4 id="L593">3.1.1. Use Case: Submitter Creates a New Study (1)</h4>

<p>A submitter creates a new study, providing a title and textual summary for
the study, and linking the new study to at least one module.</p>

<p>The submitter then proceeds to fill out the study site questionnaire.</p>

<h4 id="L930">3.1.2. Use Case: Submitter Creates a New Study (2)</h4>

<p>A submitter creates a new study, providing a title and textual summary for
the study, and linking the new study to at least one module.</p>

<p>The submitter does not immediately proceed to fill out the study site
questionnaire. Rather, she begins creating submissions and linking them to the
new study. At a later time, she comes back to the study to complete the study
site questionnaire.</p>

<h4 id="L599">3.1.3. Use Case: Submitter Creates a New Submission With a New
Data Dictionary</h4>

<p>A submitter creates a new submission, provides a title for the submission,
links the submission to at least one study and at least one module, and uploads
a file containing the initial version of the submitted data.</p>

<p>In this case, no data dictionary is already present in the system that
corresponds to the submitted data. The submitter creates a new data dictionary,
provides a title for the dictionary, and uploads a file containing the initial
version of the data dictionary. The submitter then links the initial version of
the submitted data to the initial version of the new data dictionary.</p>

<p>The submitter then makes a request for gatekeeper review of the
submission.</p>

<h4 id="L607">3.1.4. Use Case: Submitter Creates a New Submission With an
Existing Data Dictionary</h4>

<p>A submitter creates a new submission, provides a title for the submission,
links the submission to at least one study and at least one module, and uploads
a data file containing the initial version of the submitted data.</p>

<p>In this case, a data dictionary was previously created for a different
submission that also applies to the new submission. The submitter links the
initial version of the submitted data to the appropriate version of the
existing data dictionary.</p>

<p>The submitter then makes a request for gatekeeper review of the
submission.</p>

<h4 id="L615">3.1.5. Use Case: Submitter Revises a Submission Before Requesting
Gatekeeper Review</h4>

<p>A submitter creates a new submission, with a new data dictionary.</p>

<p>Before the submitter makes a request for gatekeeper review, she realises
that some data are missing in the initial version of the submitted data. She
downloads the initial version of the submitted data, adds the missing data, and
uploads a revised version of the submitted data. She then links the revised
version of the submitted data to the initial version of the data dictionary,
because neither the structure nor the semantics of the data have changed.</p>

<p>The submitter then makes a request for gatekeeper review of the
submission.</p>

<h4 id="L623">3.1.6. Use Case: Submitter Revises a Submission and Dictionary
Before Requesting Gatekeeper Review</h4>

<p>A submitter creates a new submission, with a new data dictionary.</p>

<p>Before the submitter makes a request for gatekeeper review, she realises
that some fields are missing in the initial version of the submitted data. She
downloads the initial version of the submitted data, adds the missing fields
and corresponding data, and uploads a new version of the submitted data.</p>

<p>Because the structure of the data has changed, the submitter also uploads a
new version of the data dictionary she previously created. The new version
includes a definition of each of the new fields. She then links the revised
version of the submitted data with the revised version of the data
dictionary.</p>

<p>The submitter then makes a request for gatekeeper review of the
submission.</p>

<h4 id="L633">3.1.7. Use Case: Gatekeeper Reviews and Accepts a Submission</h4>

<p>A submitter makes a request for gatekeeper review of her new submission. The
request contains a link to a specific version of the submitted data, and a
specific version of the associated data dictionary, as specified in the request
by the submitter.</p>

<p>A gatekeeper is allocated to review the request. She downloads the specified
version of the submitted data and the specified version of the data dictionary,
reviews them, and decides to accept the submission for curation. The gatekeeper
then assigns a curator to the submission, and curation begins.</p>

<h4 id="L639">3.1.8. Use Case: Gatekeeper Accepts a Submission After
Revision</h4>

<p>A submitter makes a request for gatekeeper review of their new
submission.</p>

<p>A gatekeeper is allocated to review the submission. She downloads the
specified version of the submitted data and the specified version of the data
dictionary, and reviews them.</p>

<p>In this case, the data dictionary is not complete, and the gatekeeper cannot
understand the data. The gatekeeper decides not to accept the submission,
explaining that the data dictionary is incomplete, and encouraging the
submitter to revise the data dictionary and make a new request for gatekeeper
review.</p>

<p>The submitter is notified of the outcome of the gatekeeper's review. She
then uploads a new version of the data dictionary containing the missing
information, removes the link from the initial version of the submitted data to
the initial, incomplete, version of the data dictionary, and links the initial
version of the submitted data to the revised version of the data dictionary.</p>

<p>The submitter then sends a new request for gatekeeper review of the revised
submission.</p>

<p>A gatekeeper is notified of the request for review, downloads the initial
version of the submitted data and the revised version of the data dictionary,
reviews them, and decides to accept the submission. The gatekeeper assigns a
curator, and curation begins.</p>

<h4 id="L653">3.1.9. Use Case: Submitted Data is Not Relevant to WWARN</h4>

<p>A submitter makes a request for gatekeeper review of her new submission.</p>

<p>A gatekeeper is allocated to review the submission. She downloads the
specified version of the submitted data and the specified version of the data
dictionary, and reviews them.</p>

<p>In this case, it is clear that none of the data are relevant to any of
WWARN's scientific modules. The gatekeeper decides that the submission will not
be accepted, providing an explanation of the reasons why the submission was not
accepted. The submitter is notified of the outcome of the gatekeeper's review
and their explanation of the outcome. The submitter deletes her submission.</p>

<h4 id="L661">3.1.10. Use Case: Coordinator Overview of Submission Activity</h4>

<p>A coordinator looks through a list of all submissions that are pending
gatekeeper review. She notices that one submission has been pending gatekeeper
review for more than 2 weeks. She contacts the gatekeeper assigned to review
the submission and asks that the submission be reviewed urgently.</p>

<h4 id="L665">3.1.11. Use Case: Gatekeeper Overview of Submission Activity</h4>

<p>A gatekeeper looks through a list of all submissions pending gatekeeper
review that have been allocated to her and that have not yet been reviewed. She
selects a submission from the list and reviews it.</p>

<h4 id="L669">3.1.12. Use Case: Submitter Overview of Submission Activity</h4>

<p>A submitter looks through a list of all her submissions that have been
reviewed by a gatekeeper and accepted for curation, a list of submissions that
have been reviewed and not accepted, a list of all her submissions that are
pending gatekeeper review, and all her draft submissions (for which she has not
yet requested gatekeeper review).</p>

<p>From the list of her draft submissions, she selects those that are ready for
gatekeeper review, and requests gatekeeper review for them. </p>

<h3 id="L675">3.2. Data Curation Use Cases</h3>

<p>Note that some details of the use cases below are simplified, to avoid
distracting from the key features of the use case that are relevant to the
design of Chassis/WWARN. For example, the reasons why a curator might need to
make revisions to submitted data, and the nature of the revisions they might
need to make, will be far more varied and subtle than are suggested below. </p>

<h4 id="L855">3.2.1. <a name="Notation_Conventions"></a>Notation
Conventions</h4>

<p>In the use cases below, letters A, B, C, etc., are used to help identify
different revisions of submitted data, e.g., "the initial revision of the
submitted data (A) was revised by the curator to create a new revision (B)". If
the letter has the superscript "s" (e.g., A<sup>s</sup>), then the revision is
linked to a standard data dictionary. If no superscript is present, the data is
linked to a non-standard data dictionary. </p>

<h4 id="L865">3.2.2. <a
name="Use_Case:_Curator_Manages_a_Standard_Data_Dictionary"></a>Use Case:
Curator Manages a Standard Data Dictionary</h4>

<p>A curator creates a new standard data dictionary, provides a title and
textual summary for the dictionary, links the dictionary to one or more
modules, and uploads a file containing the initial version of the dictionary.
</p>

<p>At a later time, the WWARN curators agree to make an update to this standard
data dictionary, to incorporate some new fields as standard. The curator
uploads a new file containing the revised version of the data dictionary, and
enters a log message describing the changes. </p>

<h4 id="L874">3.2.3. <a
name="Use_Case:_Curator_Manages_a_Specification_of_Release_Criteria"></a>Use
Case: Curator Manages a Release Criteria Specification</h4>

<p>A curator creates a new release criteria specification, provides a title and
textual summary for the specification, links the specification to the module to
which it applies, and uploads a file containing the initial version of the
specification. </p>

<p>At a later time, the curators agree to make the release criteria more
stringent, including new quality control criteria. The curator uploads a new
file containing the revised version of the release criteria specification, and
enters a log message describing the changes. </p>

<p>The curators review all prior data submissions that were approved with
respect to the old version of the release criteria, to determine if they also
can be approved with respect to the updated version of the release criteria.

<h2 id="L1824">5. Discussion &amp; Open Questions</h2>

<h3 id="L1833">5.1. Constraints on Data Dictionaries</h3>

<p>This document tentatively takes the position that, for the first major
release of Chassis/WWARN, there will be no constraints on the structure or
content of data dictionaries. Data dictionaries are simply uploaded as files of
any type, with any content. This position was taken because the complete range
of possible submitted data structures is not currently known, and therefore it
may be useful in the early stages of WWARN to enable some flexibility as the
consortium encounters new data and works towards a common approach to data
dictionaries.</p>

<p>However, the goal for later releases of Chassis/WWARN is to support a single
type of data dictionary, with the content of the data dictionary managed
through a web interface, rather than through the upload of files. Based on
previous experience in CGGH, the likely approach would be that each such data
dictionary would define a set of variables (also known as fields or
attributes), where each variable has a unique identifier, a human-readable
label, a human-readable definition of the variable's meaning, a datatype for
the variable, the units of the variable, and any range constraints (e.g.,
numeric constraints or controlled vocabulary) on the values the variable may
take. This would enable further functionality, such as an analysis of the
diversity of variable names used across all data submitted, which can support
the process of convergence on a common set of data standards across the
consortium. It would also be possible in some cases to use the data dictionary
to drive automated functionality such as simple validation of datatypes and
data ranges. It would also provide a basis for developing functionality to
define and execute mappings (i.e., transformations) between data conforming to
different data dictionaries, which is planned for future releases of
Chassis/WWARN.</p>

<p>Placing no constraints on the content or structure of data dictionaries, in
the first major release of Chassis/WWARN, may however have a number of
undesirable consequences. Firstly, many submitters may not have prior
experience of constructing data dictionaries, and may not know what information
to provide or how to provide it. Without clear guidance and examples, both the
quality (usefulness), the structure and the content of data dictionaries
created by submitters may be highly variable. Whilst prominent guidance and
examples may ameliorate some of these issues, there is no guarantee on
consistency or convergence towards a common approach to constructing data
dictionaries. Secondly, without any constraints on data dictionaries, it will
not be possible to reliably parse or analyse all data dictionaries, or to use
the data dictionary to support any automated functionality such as simple
validation of datatypes and data ranges. Thirdly, once a common approach to
data dictionaries is agreed and supported in Chassis/WWARN, there would be a
legacy of previously created dictionaries in a variety of formats to migrate,
which would require some effort.</p>

<p>Whether or not the first major release of Chassis/WWARN enforces a single
approach to data dictionaries, or is more flexible and places no constraints on
files uploaded as data dictionaries, is therefore an important open question in
this specification. </p>

<h3 id="Curation">5.2. Curation and Collaboration</h3>

<p>A design goal for the Chassis/WWARN system is that, for any submission under
curation, it is always clear who has responsibility for progressing that
submission forward. Thus, when the gatekeeper decides to accept a submission,
she also assigns a curator to the submission, and responsibility passes to the
assigned curator. The assigned curator then clearly sees which submissions she
has to work on.</p>

<p>If the assigned curator needs to work with other curators to complete the
work on a submission, there are at least two models under which they could
operate. </p>

<p>Under the sequential model, the assigned curator passes responsibility to
another curator, who completes some work on the submission, then either passes
responsibility back to the original curator or on to yet another curator. Only
one curator at any one time has ownership of the submission and can upload
revisions of the submitted data. </p>

<p>Under the parallel model, the assigned curator retains overall
responsibility for the submission, but grants permission to one or more other
curators to carry out work on the submission in parallel.</p>

<p>This begs the following questions. Which curators can view which
submissions? Which curators can upload revisions to which submissions? How do
we track who has responsibility for a submission at any given time, and how do
they pass responsibility to others?</p>

<h3 id="L1960">5.3. Data Dictionaries and Privacy</h3>

<p>An assumption above is that some submitters will <strong>not</strong> want
to share the content of their data dictionaries with other submitters.
Therefore, submitters can make their dictionaries private. However, to balance
the need for privacy with the need to present as few obstacles as possible to
the user, the document above introduces the ability to make a dictionary
<strong>discoverable</strong>, which means that other users can find it, but
cannot see its content. Does it make sense for some dictionaries to be
discoverable? Or should we just stick with dictionaries being either visible or
private? If we stick with the notion of discoverable dictionaries, what happens
if a submitter links their submitted data to a discoverable data dictionary?
Does the dictionary owner receive a notification, or request to grant access to
the dictionary?</p>

<h3 id="L1003">5.4. Other Discussion Points</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What happens if, for a given submission, the submitter uploads several
    files that are not revisions of each other, but are separate parts of a
    data set that is meant to be combined? </li>
  <li>Do curators need to be able to create non-standard data dictionaries, in
    addition to standard data dictionaries? </li>
  <li>Do we need an additional role, e.g. "analyst", which has read-only
    permissions for submissions under curation, so e.g., can download data,
    review it, carry out analyses on it, but cannot make revisions? </li>
  <li>Does a coordinator need the ability to re-assign the curator for a given
    submission? </li>
  <li>Does a gatekeeper need the ability to re-assign the curator for a given
    submission? </li>
  <li>Do we need some formal way for a curator to "pass the ball" back to a
    submitter for a given submission, so it is clear that the submission is
    awaiting some action by the submitter? (N.B. this is similar in principle
    to curators delegating tasks.) </li>
  <li>Should we talk about "approved" data dictionaries, rather than "standard"
    data dictionaries? Would this be any clearer? </li>
  <li>Do we need to provide any support for the social process by which a data
    dictionary becomes approved/standard, e.g., voting or ratification? Or is
    it OK to give all curators the ability to create approved/standard data
    dictionaries, and manage the process socially (outsite the system)? </li>
  <li>Do submitters need the ability to nominate collaborators on a submission,
    i.e., other users who have same permissions w.r.t. the submission as its
    initial creator? Or perhaps, collaborators with limited permissions? </li>
  <li>Do submitters need ability to make some data dictionaries private, i.e.,
    not visible to anyone but themselves? </li>
  <li>Do submitters need ability to make some studies private, i.e., not
    visible to anyone but themselves? </li>
  <li>N.B. by the model above, acceptance of a submission by gatekeeper is
    "sticky", in the sense that once a submission has been accepted by a
    gatekeeper, it doesn't matter if the submitter uploads revisions of the
    submitted data, the acceptance still applies, even if the data has changed
    completely. On the other hand, denial of a submission request is
    <strong>not</strong> sticky, but applies only to a specific request. Any
    number of submission requests can be made for any given submission. Is this
    model appropriate? </li>
  <li>Should the system force a submitter to fill out some or all of the SSQ
    prior to making a submission request to a gatekeeper? Or is it OK to manage
    gatekeeper requirements for study metadata socially? </li>
  <li>Do we need some sort of scoping mechanism to determine who can edit a
    data dictionary, e.g., by module or study? </li>
  <li>Do gatekeepers need the ability to revoke a prior acceptance of a given
    submission? </li>
  <li>Who is responsible for managing and operating the export/ingest of data
    between chassis/wwarn and <i>The WWARN Application</i>? What system will
    implement that functionality? </li>
  <li>Will export/ingest of data between chassis/wwarn and <i>The WWARN
    Application</i> be push or pull? </li>
  <li>Do submitters need the ability to pre-populate some fields of a study
    site questionnaire when creating a new study, based on values entered
    previously for a different study? </li>
  <li>Do submitters need the ability to create a batch of new studies, rather
    than one at a time? </li>
  <li>What happens if a submitter makes a request to a gatekeeper for a given
    submission, then uploads a revision of the submitted data, then makes a new
    request to a gatekeeper, before the first request has been fulfilled? This
    could be confusing/irritating for a gatekeeper if they find two requests
    pertaining to the same submission. Do submitters need the ability to cancel
    a pending request? Should there be some rule whereby a submission may have
    at most one pending request? </li>
  <li>Who makes sure that there are no duplicate study entries created? What
    happens if there are? Do we need some function for merging study entries?
  </li>
  <li>Having WWARN module heads as gatekeepers may be inappropriate if some are
    in the field for long periods of time. Gatekeepers need to be fairly
    responsive. </li>
  <li>The spec should mention entering log messages any time a revision is made
    to submitted data, or to a data dictionary. </li>
  <li>Logging in, and administration of user accounts and user roles is not
    mentioned. </li>
  <li>What are the required &amp; optional study metadata, common across
    modules? What are the required &amp; optional study metadata, for each
    module? </li>
  <li>Is it appropriate for any curators to create and revise specifications of
    release criteria? Or do we need a new role? What about the social process
    by which a revision to release criteria is accepted, does the system need
    to provide any support for that social process, e.g., voting or
    ratification? </li>
  <li>Is it appropriate for any curators to review and approve submissions for
    release? Or do we need a specific role? </li>
  <li>Can curators download revisions of submitted data that were uploaded by
    the submitter prior to the revision for which gatekeeper acceptance was
    given? Or should these earlier revisions be private to the submitter? </li>
  <li>The asymmetry between gatekeeper acceptance of a submission (which then
    applies to the submission as a whole), and gatekeeper denial of a request
    (which only applies to the version of the submitted data that was
    reviewed), is possibly counter-intuitive. </li>
  <li>Should some submitters gain automatic gatekeeper acceptance? E.g., if
    they have many previously accepted submissions? </li>
  <li>Should it be possible for more than one person to have the ball at any
    one time for a given submission, e.g., where the submitted data needs to be
    broken into parts and each part processed in parallel? I.e., do we need to
    allow an assigned curator to delegate more than one task at a time for any
    given submission? </li>
  <li>Related to the above point, what about situations where data is split
    apart, revised, then merged back together? I.e., what about versions of the
    submitted data that are derived from more than one source? N.B., this
    implies a derivation graph, rather than a derivation tree. </li>
  <li>What mechanism should we use to capture the derivation of new revisions
    to submitted data as they are uploaded? Version keys? Explicitly choosing
    the derivation source? Explicitly creating branches? Formal checkout
    mechanism? </li>
  <li>Encourate not creating multiple subs if revising data (???). </li>
  <li>How will gatekeepers be assigned to review submissions? By module? What
    if a submission applies to more than one module? Round-robin? Some modules
    have precedence over others (rock, paper, scissors)? Random? </li>
  <li>What about privacy for studies and dictionaries? Should it be possible to
    grant permissions to see details of a study, or to see a dictionary, but
    otherwise have them private? </li>
  <li>Need to make clear, each module is expected to define acceptance
    criteria, release criteria? </li>
  <li>N.B. access to analysis tools, even if submission is not shared, is
    necessary for WWARN, although possibly not for release 1.0. </li>
  <li>Need to explain "module" - submitter won't understand. </li>
  <li>When building a data dictionary, can we provide predefined units and
    datatypes? </li>
  <li>N.B. the concept of validation is wider than just dictionaries... ???
  </li>
  <li>What about tools for initial visualisation before release approval? </li>
  <li>By requesting gatekeeper review, also agreeing to share data? </li>
  <li>Should study titles be automatically constructed from other study
    metadata fields? </li>
  <li>Study title public, study SSQ private? Who can link submissions to
    private study? E.g., you can link submission to private study, study owner
    sees your request, grants you permission to link submission to their study?
  </li>
  <li>What if a submission cuts across modules? Need gatekeeper approval from
    all? Any? </li>
  <li>N.B. expect submissions for more than one module. </li>
  <li>Do we need a mechanism for defining groups of users? I.e, can someone
    define a group, and then say anyone in that group has permission to submit
    to some study? Or view some data dictionary? </li>
  <li>What about sites vs. studies? Use sites as primary organisational unit,
    rather than studies? Cf. clinicaltrial.gov. </li>
  <li>Should coordinator be able to assign review requests to a gatekeeper?
  </li>
  <li>Do we need a separate role for approving submissions for release? Release
    manager? Quality Assurer? Quality Manager? </li>
  <li>Lock stuff to capture who is working on what? </li>
  <li>Which curators can work on which submissions? </li>
  <li>Can a curator completely pass the buck? I.e., totally change the assigned
    curator? </li>
  <li>Only one node per submission can be approved for release w.r.t. one
    version of release criteria? </li>
  <li>Accept submission &amp; assign curator at same time? </li>
  <li>Can curators tidy stuff up (dead branches)? </li>
  <li>What about if submitter creates something derived from a curator's
    revision? Lose derivation if simplified. </li>
  <li>Can we drop use cases where submitter revises prior to requesting
    gatekeeper review? </li>
  <li>Should curator manage release criteria? Or define some other role? </li>
  <li>Can you assign yourself as curator for a submission? </li>
  <li>Does task imply permissions? I.e., is a submission locked to the assigned
    curator? </li>
  <li>Can you delete previous file revisions? Can you delete whole submissions?
  </li>
  <li>Can you overwrite/clear previous mappings to a standard? </li>
  <li>What about reassigning a curator? Who can do that? Gatekeeper?
    Coordinator? </li>
  <li>What about dropping submissions as an entity, only have requests (for
    gatekeeper review)? </li>
  <li>Gatekeeper can see other gatekeeper's requests? </li>
  <li>What about correlation report functionality? E.g. link clinical data to
    sample labels? </li>
