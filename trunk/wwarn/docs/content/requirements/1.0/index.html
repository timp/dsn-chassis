<h2 id="L55">1. Introduction</h2>

<h3 id="Scope">1.1. Scope of Chassis/WWARN</h3>

<h4 id="WWARN">1.1.1. WWARN Data Management</h4>

<p>The <em>Chassis/WWARN</em> system is intended to support the <strong>data
management activities</strong> of the WWARN data-sharing network. These data
management activities include the <strong>submission</strong> of data,
<strong>curation</strong> of submitted data to meet quality control and other
(e.g., ethical) criteria as defined by WWARN, and <strong>mapping</strong> of
submitted data onto WWARN standard data dictionaries. </p>

<p>The end goal of these data management activities is to produce data that is
suitable for ingest into and publication by The WWARN Application.</p>

<h4 id="Chassis">1.1.2. Chassis/WWARN and The WWARN Application</h4>

<p>Note that the <em>Chassis/WWARN</em> system is distinct from <em>The WWARN
Application</em>. The WWARN Application is a separate system, intended to
support the visualisation, analysis, sharing and publication of standardised
data. </p>

<p>This specification assumes that data will be periodically exported from the
Chassis/WWARN system and ingested into The WWARN Application. Management of
this export and ingest process is out of scope for the Chassis/WWARN system,
and will be specified elsewhere. Requirements for The WWARN Application,
including all requirements for data visualisation and analysis tools, are not
in scope for this document, and are specified elsewhere.</p>

<h4 id="First">1.1.3. First Major Release (1.0)</h4>

<p>This document specifies mandatory requirements ("must-haves") for the first
major release (1.0) of the Chassis/WWARN system for production use by WWARN.
</p>

<p>The goal of the 1.0 release of Chassis/WWARN is to provide a system that
supports the <strong>bare minimum</strong> needed to enable WWARN to begin
accepting and curating data submissions. I.e., a system that is just sufficient
to enable WWARN to establish key operating procedures and begin basic data
management activities, and that can therefore be delivered as soon as possible.
The functionality of the 1.0 release (as specified here) should therefore be
limited to those features that are deemed <strong>absolutely necessary</strong>
to enable the basic data management operations of WWARN to commence.</p>

<p>Subsequent releases of Chassis/WWARN will then provide additional
functionality as needed. Specifying this additional functionality is not in
scope for this document, however, some features that might be developed for
future releases of Chassis/WWARN are briefly discussed.</p>

<p>The aim for the Chassis/WWARN 1.0 release is to coincide with the first
WWARN milestone, which is scheduled for Q1 (Jan) 2010. However, because this
document is in flux, and requirements may be added or removed, it is not
possible to provide a precise release date at this stage. The informatics team
will, however, provide access to working prototypes as often as possible on the
way towards the 1.0 release, so the rest of the consortium can evaluate
functionality and progress.</p>

<p>Note that, as this document currently stands, it is quite likely that the
set of requirements is more than can be realistically be achieved by Q1 2010.
Once the consortium has achieved some consensus on the key points of the data
submission and curation workflows, it is suggested that we attempt to reduce
and/or prioritise the functional requirements given below. </p>

<h4 id="L614">1.1.4. Limited Release for WHO Data Submission (0.1)</h4>

<p>Note that a limited functionality release (0.1) of Chassis/WWARN, enabling
submission of data using the WHO spreadsheet format only, is also planned. The
requirements for Chassis/WWARN (0.1) will be specified in a separate document,
however, they are expected to form a subset of the requirements specified here.
</p>

<h4 id="L1241">1.1.5. Managing User Accounts</h4>

<p>This document assumes that management of user accounts, user roles, and
authentication for the Chassis/WWARN system will be handled via the CGGH user
account database and single sign-on system. This document therefore does not
include any functionality for managing user accounts, assigning roles to users,
or authenticating users (i.e., logging in and out of the system).</p>

<h3 id="L632">1.2. About This Document</h3>

<h4 id="L641">1.2.1. Intended Audience</h4>

<p>This document is an internal draft, intended for discussion within the WWARN
consortium. It is meant to provide a concise description of the functionality
provided by Chassis/WWARN 1.0. It is not intended for end-users of the
Chassis/WWARN system.</p>

<h4 id="L655">1.2.2. Working Draft</h4>

<p>This document is a working draft, and is intended to act as a focus for
discussion within the WWARN consortium. Feedback is very welcome, and may be
sent via email to informatics@wwarn.org.</p>

<p>Where there may be several possible choices relating to a particular
requirement, some discussion is included in the document below, in the <a
href="@@TODO LINK">Discussion &amp; Open Questions</a> section.</p>

<h4 id="L1887">1.2.3. Chassis/*</h4>

<p>This user requirements specification is scoped to the requirements of the
WWARN data-sharing network. However, note that the Chassis/WWARN system is
intended to be the first instance of a generic platform (Chassis/*), which can
be customised to support the data management activities of other, similar,
data-sharing networks. Therefore, this specification aims to describe
requirements in a generic way, wherever possible, using terminology that is
transferable to other data-sharing networks. </p>

<h4 id="L719">1.2.4. Structure of This Document</h4>

<p>@@TODO</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="L840">2. Workflow - Summary of Key Points</h2>

<p>This section summarises the key points of the data management workflow that
Chassis/WWARN will be designed to support. </p>

<p>This section does not cover all requirements in detail. See the section
below on use cases and functional requirements for detailed coverage of these
points.</p>

<h3 id="L870">2.1. Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h3>

<p>The following roles are defined here for users of the Chassis/WWARN
system.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <strong>user</strong> is anyone who is authorized to access the
    Chassis/WWARN system.</li>
  <li>A <strong>submitter</strong> is a user who can create a data submission.
    A submitter represents and is assumed to act for the people and/or
    organisations who have intellectual property rights and copyright over any
    data they submit.</li>
  <li>A <strong>gatekeeper</strong> is a user with the authority to accept a
    data submission for curation. By accepting a submission, the gatekeeper is
    asserting that the submission is relevant to WWARN, and authorising the
    expenditure of resources (i.e., time and effort) on curating the
  submission.</li>
  <li>A <strong>curator</strong> is a user who will perform curation
    activities, which might include (but are not limited to) reviewing
    submitted data, revising submitted data, ensuring that data meet quality
    control criteria and conform to standard data dictionaries.</li>
  <li>A <strong>coordinator</strong> is a user who has overall responsibility
    for the operations of a data-sharing network.</li>
  <li>An <strong>administrator</strong> is a user with the authority to
    configure the Chassis/WWARN system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the same user may hold more than one of the above roles.</p>

<h3 id="L1386">2.2. Data Submission Workflow</h3>

<h4 id="L310">2.2.1. Creating Submissions</h4>

<p>Data submission is the process whereby new data enters the Chassis/WWARN
system.</p>

<p>A submitter initiates the process by <strong>creating a new
submission</strong>. Creating a submission involves providing a title and
textual summary for the submission, linking the submission to at least one
study (see below), and linking the submission to at least one WWARN module. The
submitter then uploads a data file containing the initial version of the
submitted data. </p>

<h4 id="L369">2.2.2. Submission Ownership, Permissions and Privacy</h4>

<p>When a new submission is created, the submitter who created it becomes the
sole <strong>owner</strong> of that submission. The submission owner can the
grant ownership to other submitters. All owners will have the same permissions
with respect to the submission as the initial owner, for example, they will all
be able to edit the submission title and summary, and upload revisions to the
submitted data (see below).</p>

<p>When a new submission is created, it is initially in a
<strong>draft</strong> state. It is also private to its owner(s), and is not
visible to any other users of the system.</p>

<h4 id="L353">2.2.3. Creating Studies</h4>

<p>When a submitter is creating a new submission, they must link the new
submission to at least one study.</p>

<p>Before creating the first submission for a study, a submitter will have to
create a record for the study. Creating a study involves providing at a title
and textual summary for the study, and linking the new study to at least one
WWARN module.</p>

<p>Once a study has been created, the submitter can then proceed to enter
further metadata about the study (i.e., to fill out the study site
questionnaire). However, to present the minimum obstacle to the submitter, it
is <strong>not</strong> necessary that any further study metadata be entered
before a submitter can begin creating new submissions linked to the study, or
request gatekeeper review for those submissions. (A gatekeeper could, on the
other hand, require that some or all of the study site questionnaire be
completed before a submission can be accepted for curation, i.e., completing
some or all of the SSQ could form part of the gatekeeper's acceptance criteria,
see below.)</p>

<h4 id="L392">2.2.4. Study Ownership, Permissions and Privacy</h4>

<p>When a new study is created, the submitter who created it becomes the sole
<strong>owner</strong> of that study. The study owner can also grant ownership
to other submitters. All owners will have the same permissions with respect to
the study as the initial owner, for example, they will be able to edit the
study site questionnaire. </p>

<p>The owner(s) of a study can choose to make the study
<strong>visible</strong>, in which case any user of the system will be able to
find the study and view all details of the study site questionnaire, or
<strong>discoverable</strong>, in which case any user of the system will be
able to find the study and view its title and summary but will not be able to
view any other information about the study, or <strong>private</strong>, in
which case only the study owner(s) and authorised submitters will be able to
find it and view its details.</p>

<p>In order to present the minimum obstacle to the submitter, the system will
allow <strong>any</strong> submitter to link their submissions to
<strong>any</strong> visible or discoverable study, even if they are
<strong></strong><strong>not</strong> an owner of that study, and even if they
have <strong>not</strong> been authorised by the study owner(s). In this case,
the owner(s) of the study will be notified that the new submission has been
linked to the study by an as-yet unauthorised submitter, and will be given the
opportunity to grant the necessary authorisation to the submitter. (Note also
that a gatekeeper could require that the submitter has the appropriate
authorisation from the study owner(s) beforing accepting a submission for
curation, i.e., being an owner or authorized submitter for the study or studies
to which a submission is linked could form part of the gatekeeper's acceptance
criteria, see also below.)</p>

<h4 id="L426">2.2.5. Submitted Data</h4>

<p>The first step after creating a submission is to upload a single data file
containing the initial version of the submitted data. </p>

<p>Note that Chassis/WWARN (1.0) does <strong>not</strong> place any
constraints on the nature or format of the data file uploaded as submitted
data. The Chassis/WWARN (1.0) system will not attempt to parse the submitted
data file, and will not provide any previews of the submitted data. Later
versions of Chassis/WWARN may provide support for parsing and previewing of
some data files, e.g., where data files conform to a standard data dictionary,
or where data files contain a single table of data in a spreadsheet format.</p>

<h4 id="L1452">2.2.6. Data Dictionaries</h4>

<p>The Chassis/WWARN system requires that submitted data must be linked to a
data dictionary, before a submission can be reviewed by a gatekeeper and
accepted for curation (see also below). </p>

<p>Creating a data dictionary involves providing a title and textual summary
for the dictionary, linking the dictionary to at least one WWARN module, and
uploading a file containing the initial version of the dictionary.</p>

<p>A data dictionary defines the structure (i.e., layout, format) and semantics
(i.e., meaning) of submitted data. It is expected that a data dictionary will
<strong>at least</strong> provide a list of the field or variable names used in
the data, and a textual definition of each field. Ideally, the dictionary would
also specify the datatype of each field (e.g., integer, decimal, text), the
units of the field (e.g., g/dl), and any constraints on the range of values for
that field (e.g., numeric range constraints for a field with a numeric
datatype, or controlled vocabulary constraints for a field with a text
datatype). </p>

<p>Note, however, that Chassis/WWARN (1.0) does <strong>not</strong> place any
restrictions on the nature or format of the data dictionary file uploaded when
a new data dictionary is created or revised. The system will not attempt to
parse the data dictionary file, nor provide any preview of its contents. Later
versions of Chassis/WWARN may constrain the content and layout of data
dictionary files, and parse files to store and provide views of data
dictionaries. Later versions of the system may also provide online support for
creating and editing the contents of data dictionaries, without needing to
upload files. See also the <a href="@@TODO">discussion of data dictionaries</a>
below.</p>

<h4 id="L454">2.2.7. Data Dictionary Ownership, Privacy and Sharing</h4>

<p>When a new dictionary is created, the submitter who created it becomes the
sole <strong>owner</strong> of that dictionary. The dictionary owner can then
grant ownership to other submitters. All owners will have the same permissions
with respect to the dictionary as the initial owner, for example, the ability
to revise the dictionary.</p>

<p>The owner(s) of a dictionary can choose to make the dictionary
<strong>visible</strong>, in which case any user of the system will be able to
find and view the dictionary, or <strong>discoverable</strong>, in which case
any user of the system will be able to find the dictionary and view its title
and summary but will not be able to view the content of the dictionary, or
<strong>private</strong>, in which case only the dictionary owner(s) and
authorised submitters will be able to find it and view its content.</p>

<p>A submitter can create a new data dictionary for each new submission, or
re-use an existing data dictionary created by themselves, or re-use a
dictionary created by someone else. In order to present the minimum obstacle to
the submitter, the system will allow <strong>any</strong> submitter to link
their submitted data to <strong>any</strong> visible or discoverable
dictionary. See also @@TODO discussion link.</p>

<h4 id="L1494">2.2.8. Gatekeeper Review</h4>

<p>Before a submission can progress beyond the draft state and be
<strong>accepted for curation</strong>, it must first be reviewed by a
gatekeeper. </p>

<p>When a submitter has finished preparing their submission, they can
<strong>request a gatekeeper review</strong> of the submission. Until that
point, the submission is in a draft state, and is private to the submission
owner(s). Once the request has been made for gatekeeper review, a gatekeeper
will be assigned to review the submission. The assigned gatekeeper may then
view the details of the submission, the submitted data, and the associated data
dictionary.</p>

<p>The gatekeeper is responsible for performing an initial evaluation of the
submitted data and accompanying data dictionary, to determine whether or not
resources (i.e., time and effort) should be spent curating the data, and with
what priority. The gatekeeper is <strong>not</strong> responsible for making
any modifications to the data or approving the data for release to The WWARN
Application. </p>

<p>The outcome of a gatekeeper review is either to accept the submission for
curation, or not to accept the submission for curation. Once a gatekeeper has
accepted a submission, they can assign a curator to the submission.
Responsibility for the submission then passes from the gatekeeper to the
assigned curator.</p>

<p>There may be more than one gatekeeper. For Chassis/WWARN, it is anticipated
that each WWARN module will have its own gatekeeper(s), and that submissions
will be assigned to a gatekeeper based on the module(s) to which the submission
is linked by its submitter.</p>

<p>The criteria that the gatekeeper use to decide whether or not to accept a
submission are referred to here as <strong>acceptance criteria</strong>. Each
module may have different acceptance criteria. A module may also have no
acceptance criteria, i.e., may accept all submissions by default. </p>

<p>A gatekeeper may also assign a priority to an accepted submission.</p>

<h4 id="L1677">2.2.9. Revising Submissions</h4>

<p>Before a submitter has requested gatekeeper review of a submission, they can
upload revisions to the submitted data. A submitter can also make revisions
after a submission is accepted for curation. </p>

<p>If a submission is not accepted, a submitter can revise a submission after
the gatekeeper's review, and make a new request for gatekeeper review of the
revised submission. </p>

<h3 id="L363">2.3. Data Curation Workflow</h3>

<h4 id="L365">2.3.1. Curation Overview</h4>

<p>The curation process takes submitted data as input and produces data that is
suitable for <strong>release</strong> to The WWARN Application, and hence made
available for visualisation, analysis, sharing and publication.</p>

<p>The curation process comprises a wide and open-ended range of possible
activities. However, in general, curation activities are either
<strong>revision activities</strong>, which involve revising the submitted data
in some way (e.g., adding, removing, or restructuring data), or <strong>review
activities</strong>, where the submitted data are reviewed with respect to some
criteria (e.g., ethical criteria, quality control criteria) and an assertion is
made that the data either do or do not meet those criteria.</p>

<h4 id="L508">2.3.2. Transformation and Mapping to WWARN Standard Data
Dictionaries</h4>

<p>In addition to the non-standard data dictionaries that submitters can
create, the Chassis/WWARN system has one or more data dictionaries managed by
the curators that are agreed <strong>WWARN standard data dictionaries</strong>.
WWARN standard data dictionaries are like any other data dictionaries, in that
they define expectations for the structure and semantics of submitted data,
except that they are maintained by the curators.</p>

<p>A special type of revision activity involves transforming data that is
submitted in a non-standard form into something that conforms with one of the
standard data dictionaries. Defining such a transformation is also referred to
here as "mapping". </p>

<p>In the Chassis/WWARN 1.0 release, no support will be provided for
transforming data. I.e., it is assumed that all data will be transformed using
other systems, e.g., off-line desktop tools. Later versions of Chassis/WWARN
may provide online support for defining and executing mappings between data
conforming to different data dictionaries.</p>

<h4 id="L791">2.3.3. Validation</h4>

<p>A special type of review activity involves checking that submitted data
conform with respect to a given data dictionary, also referred to here as
"validation". The Chassis/WWARN 1.0 release will not provide any support for
validation. I.e., it is assumed that validation will be performed using other
systems, e.g., by manual review, or using off-line desktop tools. Later
versions of Chassis/WWARN may provide some online support for validation, where
possible. </p>

<p>Note that, just because data conforms to the structural and semantic
conditions of a standard data dictionary, does not necessarily mean that the
data are reliable or make any sense. I.e., quality control is a separate
concern from mapping submitted data to standard data dictionaries (see also
below). </p>

<h4 id="L427">2.3.4. Release Criteria</h4>

<p>A submission cannot be released to The WWARN Application unless the
submitted data conforms to one of the WWARN standard data dictionaries.
Therefore, the minimum curation activity for a submission is to check that the
submitted data conforms to a WWARN standard data dictionary, and if not, to
transform the data into something that does.</p>

<p>In addition to checking that submitted data conform to one of the WWARN
standard data dictionaries, the curators may also define additional
<strong>release criteria</strong> for submissions, which might include, e.g.,
ethical and/or quality control criteria. In order to make those criteria
explicit, the curators may document them in a <strong>specification of release
criteria</strong>. The Chassis/WWARN system will provide support for creating
and revising specifications of release criteria.</p>

<p>The curators may then review any submission, with respect to a given
specification of release criteria, and assert whether or not the submitted data
are <strong>approved</strong> with respect to those release criteria.</p>

<p>The curators may define <strong>more than one</strong> specification of
release criteria, e.g., to represent different degrees of confidence in the
submitted data. The Chassis/WWARN system will expose information about which
submissions have been approved by the curators with respect to which set of
release criteria to The WWARN Application, which will enable users of The WWARN
Application to filter data in visualisations and analyses by different sets of
release criteria.</p>

<p>Specifications of release criteria will also be versioned, to enable
criteria to be modified or updated without confusing the status of previously
reviewed data.</p>

<p>Each WWARN module may also define and maintain its own specifications of
release criteria.</p>

<h4 id="L451">2.3.5. Making Studies and Submissions Public</h4>

<p>All submissions are, by default, <strong>private</strong>, which means they
are visible only to their owner(s), and to the Chassis/WWARN gatekeepers and
curators. It is anticipated that submissions which are private, but where the
submitted data conforms to a standard data dictionary, <strong>will</strong> be
consumed and made available for analysis and visualisation by The WWARN
Application, but that The WWARN Application will respect the privacy
constraints that are defined within the Chassis/WWARN system. I.e., in the case
of private submissions, only the submission's owners will be able to view
visualisations and analyses of data from their submission, and the data will
<strong>not</strong> be included in any public aggregations.</p>

<p>A submission's owner(s) may also choose to make their submission
<strong>public</strong> at any time. Where a submission has been made public,
and where the submitted data conforms to a standard data dictionary, it is
assumed that the data will then be consumed and made publicly available by The
WWARN Application, and included in public aggregated analyses.</p>

<p>A submission can only be made public if at least one of the studies to which
the submission is linked has also been made public. If a study has been made
public, then it is assumed that some details of the study will appear in the
public areas of The WWARN Application.</p>

<h4>2.3.6. Curation and Collaboration</h4>

<p>See the @@TODO discussion link.</p>

<h4 id="L455">2.3.7. Ordering of Curation Activities</h4>

<p>The Chassis/WWARN system does not prescribe the order in which data are
mapped to a standard data dictionary and revised to meet quality control
standards and other release criteria. I.e., data may be submitted in a
non-standard form, revised to meet quality control standards, and then mapped
to a standard data dictionary; or data may be first mapped to a standard data
dictionary, and then revised to meet quality control criteria; or revisions to
address quality issues may be applied both before and after mapping to a
standard data dictionary.</p>

<h4 id="L938">2.3.8. Provenance and Derivation of Data</h4>

<p>A key design goal for Chassis/WWARN is that the complete and true derivation
of any data released to The WWARN Application must be recorded. By derivation,
we mean the complete sequence of actions and revisions that led from the data
as initially submitted to the data in its released form, i.e., its
provenance.</p>

<p>A curator can upload revisions of submitted data. To ensure that the true
derivation of any data revision is captured, the curator must explicitly assert
the derivation of any new revision they make, i.e., they must select the
version of the data (either submitter version or another curator version) that
was taken as input to the curator's new revision. This also ensures that
curators can go back and do work on versions of the submitted data other than
the latest version, and an accurate audit trail of their activities will still
be maintained. (I.e., for any one submission, the curators' revisions to the
submitted data are assumed to form an arbitrarily branching tree, where the
root of each tree is one of the submitter's revisions.)</p>

<p>A submitter can upload a revision of submitted data at any time. To keep
things simple for a submitter, they do not have to assert the derivation of
each new revision. (I.e., for any one submission, the submitter's revisions of
the submitted data are assumed to form a single linear version series.) </p>

<h2 id="L584">3. Use Cases</h2>

<p>The use cases below provide a more detailed illustration of how a user will
interact with the Chassis/WWARN (1.0) system, in the most commonly anticipated
situations. The use cases are <strong>not</strong> exhaustive, i.e., are not
intended to cover all aspects of the system functionality.</p>

<h3 id="L591">3.1. Data Submission Use Cases</h3>

<h4 id="L593">3.1.1. Use Case: Submitter Creates a New Study</h4>

<p>A submitter creates a new study, providing at a title and textual summary
for the study, and linking the new study to at least one module.</p>

<p>The submitter then proceeds to fill out the study site questionnaire.</p>

<h4 id="L599">3.1.2. Use Case: Submitter Creates a New Submission With a New
Data Dictionary</h4>

<p>A submitter creates a new submission, provides a title for the submission,
links the submission to at least one study and at least one module, and uploads
a file containing the initial version of the submitted data.</p>

<p>In this case, no data dictionary is already present in the system that
corresponds to the submitted data. The submitter creates a new data dictionary,
provides a title for the dictionary, and uploads a file containing the initial
version of the data dictionary. The submitter then links the initial version of
the submitted data to the initial version of the new data dictionary.</p>

<p>The submitter then makes a request for gatekeeper review of the
submission.</p>

<h4 id="L607">3.1.3. Use Case: Submitter Creates a New Submission With an
Existing Data Dictionary</h4>

<p>A submitter creates a new submission, provides a title for the submission,
links the submission to at least one study and at least one module, and uploads
a data file containing the initial version of the submitted data.</p>

<p>In this case, a data dictionary was previously created for a different
submission that also applies to the new submission. The submitter links the
initial version of the submitted data to the appropriate version of the
existing data dictionary.</p>

<p>The submitter then makes a request for gatekeeper review of the
submission.</p>

<h4 id="L615">3.1.4. Use Case: Submitter Revises a Submission Before Requesting
Gatekeeper Review</h4>

<p>A submitter creates a new submission, with a new data dictionary.</p>

<p>Before the submitter makes a request for gatekeeper review, she realises
that some data are missing in the initial version of the submitted data. She
downloads the initial version of the submitted data, adds the missing data, and
uploads a revised version of the submitted data. She then links the revised
version of the submitted data to the initial version of the data dictionary,
because neither the structure nor the semantics of the data have changed.</p>

<p>The submitter then makes a request for gatekeeper review of the
submission.</p>

<h4 id="L623">3.1.5. Use Case: Submitter Revises a Submission and Dictionary
Before Requesting Gatekeeper Review</h4>

<p>A submitter creates a new submission, with a new data dictionary.</p>

<p>Before the submitter makes a request for gatekeeper review, she realises
that some fields are missing in the initial version of the submitted data. She
downloads the initial version of the submitted data, adds the missing fields
and corresponding data, and uploads a new version of the submitted data.</p>

<p>Because the structure of the data has changed, the submitter also uploads a
new version of the data dictionary she previously created. The new version
includes a definition of each of the new fields. She then links the revised
version of the submitted data with the revised version of the data
dictionary.</p>

<p>The submitter then makes a request for gatekeeper review of the
submission.</p>

<h4 id="L633">3.1.6. Use Case: Gatekeeper Reviews and Accepts a Submission</h4>

<p>A submitter makes a request for gatekeeper review of her new submission. The
request contains a link to a specific version of the submitted data, and a
specific version of the associated data dictionary, as specified in the request
by the submitter.</p>

<p>A gatekeeper is allocated to review the request. She downloads the specified
version of the submitted data and the specified version of the data dictionary,
reviews them, and decides to accept the submission for curation. The gatekeeper
then assigns a curator to the submission, and curation begins.</p>

<h4 id="L639">3.1.7. Use Case: Gatekeeper Accepts a Submission After
Revision</h4>

<p>A submitter makes a request for gatekeeper review of their new
submission.</p>

<p>A gatekeeper is allocated to review the request. She downloads the specified
version of the submitted data and the specified version of the data dictionary,
and reviews them.</p>

<p>In this case, the data dictionary is not complete, and the gatekeeper cannot
understand the data. The gatekeeper decides not to accept the submission,
explaining that the data dictionary is incomplete, and encouraging the
submitter to revise the data dictionary and make a new request for gatekeeper
review.</p>

<p>The submitter is notified of the outcome of the gatekeeper's review. She
then uploads a new version of the data dictionary containing the missing
information, removes the link from the initial version of the submitted data to
the initial, incomplete, version of the data dictionary, and links the initial
version of the submitted data to the revised version of the data dictionary.</p>

<p>The submitter then sends a new request for gatekeeper review of the revised
submission.</p>

<p>A gatekeeper is notified of the request for review, downloads the initial
version of the submitted data and the revised version of the data dictionary,
reviews them, and decides to accept the submission. The gatekeeper assigns a
curator, and curation begins.</p>

<h4 id="L653">3.1.8. Use Case: Submitted Data is Not Relevant to WWARN</h4>

<p>A submitter makes a request for gatekeeper review of her new submission.</p>

<p>A gatekeeper is allocated to review the request. She downloads the specified
version of the submitted data and the specified version of the data dictionary,
and reviews them.</p>

<p>In this case, it is clear that none of the data are relevant to any of
WWARN's scientific modules. The gatekeeper decides that the submission will not
be accepted, providing an explanation of the reasons why the submission was not
accepted. The submitter is notified of the outcome of the gatekeeper's review
and their explanation of the outcome. The submitter deletes her submission.</p>

<h4 id="L661">3.1.9. Use Case: Coordinator Overview of Submission Activity</h4>

<p>A coordinator looks through a list of all submissions that are pending
gatekeeper review. She notices that one submission has been pending gatekeeper
review for more than 2 weeks. She contacts the gatekeeper assigned to review
the submission and asks that the submission be reviewed urgently.</p>

<h4 id="L665">3.1.10. Use Case: Gatekeeper Overview of Submission Activity</h4>

<p>A gatekeeper looks through a list of all submission requests that have been
allocated to her and that have not yet been reviewed. She selects a request
from the list and reviews it.</p>

<h4 id="L669">3.1.11. Use Case: Submitter Overview of Submission Activity</h4>

<p>A submitter looks through a list of all her submissions that have been
reviewed by a gatekeeper and accepted for curation, a list of submissions that
have been reviewed and not accepted, a list of all her submissions that are
pending gatekeeper review, and all her draft submissions (for which she has not
yet requested gatekeeper review).</p>

<p>From the list of her draft submissions, she selects those that are ready for
gatekeeper review, and requests gatekeeper review for them. </p>

<h3 id="L675">3.2. Data Curation Use Cases</h3>

<p>Note that some details of the use cases below are simplified, to avoid
distracting from the key features of the use case that are relevant to
Chassis/WWARN. For example, the reasons why a curator might need to make
revisions to submitted data, and the nature of the revisions they might need to
make, will be far more varied and subtle than are suggested below. </p>

<h4>3.2.1. <a name="Notation_Conventions"></a>Notation Conventions</h4>

<p>In the use cases below, letters A, B, C, etc., are used to help identify
different revisions of submitted data, e.g., "the initial revision of the
submitted data (A) was revised by the curator to create a new revision (B)". If
the letter has the superscript "s" (e.g., A<sup>s</sup>), then the revision is
linked to a standard data dictionary. If no superscript is present, the data is
linked to a non-standard data dictionary. </p>

<h4>3.2.2. <a
name="Use_Case:_Curator_Manages_a_Standard_Data_Dictionary"></a>Use Case:
Curator Manages a Standard Data Dictionary</h4>

<p>A curator creates a new standard data dictionary, provides a title and
textual summary for the dictionary, links the dictionary to one or more
modules, and uploads a file containing the initial version of the dictionary.
</p>

<p>At a later time, the WWARN curators agree to make an update to this standard
data dictionary, to incorporate some new fields as standard. The curator
uploads a new file containing the revised version of the data dictionary, and
enters a log message describing the changes. </p>

<h4>3.2.3. <a
name="Use_Case:_Curator_Manages_a_Specification_of_Release_Criteria"></a>Use
Case: Curator Manages a Specification of Release Criteria</h4>

<p>A curator creates a new specification of release criteria, provides a title
and textual summary for the specification, links the specification to the
module to which it applies, and uploads a file containing the initial version
of the specification. </p>

<p>At a later time, the WWARN curators agree to make the release criteria more
stringent, including new quality control criteria. The curator uploads a new
file containing the revised version of the specificiation of release criteria,
and enters a log message describing the changes. </p>

<p>The curators review all prior data submissions that were approved with
respect to the old version of the release criteria, to determine if they also
can be approved with respect to the updated version of the release criteria.
</p>

<h4>3.2.4. <a
name="Use_Case:_Standard_Submission,_Requires_No_Curation"></a>Use Case:
Standard Submission, Requires No Curation</h4>

<p>A submitter requests gatekeeper review for a new submission, where the
submitted data is already linked by the submitter to a WWARN standard data
dictionary. A gatekeeper accepts the submission and assigns a curator. </p>

<p>The assigned curator reviews the initial version of the submitted data
(A<sup>s</sup>), and finds that no changes need to be made. She reviews the
submitted data with respect to the latest version of the appropriate data
release criteria, and asserts that the release criteria have been met. </p>

<p>The submitter sees that her initial version of the submitted data
(A<sup>s</sup>) has been approved for release to <i>The WWARN Application</i>,
and that no other actions were taken. </p>

<h4>3.2.5. <a name="Use_Case:_Curation_of_Standard_Submission"></a>Use Case:
Curation of Standard Submission</h4>

<p>A submitter requests gatekeeper review for a new submission, where the
submitted data is already linked to a WWARN standard data dictionary. A
gatekeeper accepts the submission and assigns a curator. </p>

<p>The assigned curator downloads the initial version of the submitted data
(A<sup>s</sup>), reviews it, and finds that some rows have missing data values.
She removes the rows with missing data, uploads a new data file containing the
revised data (B<sup>s</sup>), links it to the version of the submitted data
from which it was derived (A<sup>s</sup>), and links it to the standard data
dictionary. She also enters a log message explaining what changes were made and
why. </p>

<p>The assigned curator then reviews the submitted data (B<sup>s</sup>) with
respect to the latest version of the appropriate data release criteria, and
asserts that the release criteria have been met. </p>

<p>The submitter sees that her submission has been approved for release to
<i>The WWARN Application</i>, after the assigned curator made a revision
(B<sup>s</sup>) to her initial version (A<sup>s</sup>). She downloads the
curator's revision (B<sup>s</sup>) to inspect the changes. </p>

<h4>3.2.6. <a
name="Use_Case:_Standard_Submission_Requires_Submitter_Revision"></a>Use Case:
Standard Submission Requires Submitter Revision</h4>

<p>A submitter requests gatekeeper review for a new submission, where the
submitted data is already linked to a WWARN standard data dictionary. A
gatekeeper accepts the submission and assigns a curator. </p>

<p>The assigned curator downloads the initial version of the submitted data
(A<sup>s</sup>), reviews it, and finds that some rows have data values that
appear to be out of range. She decides to contact the submitter, and notify her
of the problem. </p>

<p>The submitter realises that some errors were made in the initial version of
the submitted data (A<sup>s</sup>). The submitter downloads her initial version
of the submitted data (A<sup>s</sup>), fixes the errors, and uploads a new
version of the submitted data (B<sup>s</sup>). </p>

<p>The assigned curator then reviews the submitted data (B<sup>s</sup>) with
respect to the latest version of the appropriate data release criteria, and
asserts that the release criteria have been met. </p>

<p>The submitter sees that her submission has been approved for release to
<i>The WWARN Application</i>, after she made a revision (B<sup>s</sup>) to her
initial version (A<sup>s</sup>). </p>

<h4>3.2.7. <a name="Use_Case:_Curation_of_Non-Standard_Submission"></a>Use
Case: Curation of Non-Standard Submission</h4>

<p>A submitter requests gatekeeper review for a new submission with a new data
dictionary. The data dictionary is not one of the WWARN standard data
dictionaries. A gatekeeper accepts the submission and assigns a curator. </p>

<p>The assigned curator downloads the initial version of the submitted data (A)
and the initial version of the data dictionary. She finds that several rows
appear to be missing some data values. She removes the rows with missing data,
uploads her revised version of the submitted data (B), links it to the version
of the submitted data from which it was derived (A), links it to the
non-standard data dictionary, and enters a log message describing the changes
she has made and the reasons for making the changes. </p>

<p>The assigned curator then decides to map the submitted data onto the
appropriate standard data dictionary. She downloads her curated revision of the
submitted data (B), and downloads the latest version of the appropriate
standard data dictionary. Using her favourite desktop data transformation tool,
she creates a new data file conforming to the standard data dictionary. She
then uploads this new data file (C<sup>s</sup>), links it to the version of the
submitted data from which it was derived (B), links it to the latest version of
the standard data dictionary, and enters a log message describing the
transformation she performed. </p>

<p>The assigned curator now believes the data is ready for release to <i>The
WWARN Application</i>. She reviews her standardised version of the submitted
data (C<sup>s</sup>) with respect to the latest version of the WWARN data
release criteria, and asserts that the release criteria have been met. The data
are then made available for export to <i>The WWARN Application</i>. </p>

<p>The submitter sees that her initial version of the submitted data (A) has
undergone one curation revision (B, derived from A), one standardisation
revision (C<sup>s</sup>, derived from B), and has been approved for release to
<i>The WWARN Application</i>. </p>

<h4>3.2.8. <a
name="Use_Case:_Non-Standard_Submission,_Curation_and_Repeated_Standar"></a>Use
Case: Non-Standard Submission, Curation and Repeated Standardisation</h4>

<p>A submitter requests gatekeeper review for a new submission with a new data
dictionary. The data dictionary is not one of the WWARN standard data
dictionaries. A gatekeeper accepts the submission and assigns a curator. </p>

<p>The assigned curator downloads the initial version of the submitted data (A)
and makes a revision (B), without changing the structure of the data. </p>

<p>The assigned curator then decides to map the submitted data onto the
appropriate standard data dictionary. She downloads her curated revision of the
submitted data (B), and creates a new data file conforming to the appropriate
standard data dictionary. She then uploads this new data file (C<sup>s</sup>),
links it to the version of the submitted data from which it was derived (B),
links it to the latest version of the standard data dictionary, and enters a
log message describing the transformation she performed. </p>

<p>The assigned curator now believes the data is ready for release to <i>The
WWARN Application</i>. She reviews her standardised version of the submitted
data (C<sup>s</sup>) with respect to the latest version of the WWARN data
release criteria, but finds some problems in the standardised data. She
realises that the problems are due to the standardisation transformation she
applied. She goes back to the curated, non-standard revision of the submitted
data (B), and repeats her transformation, correcting the previous errors. She
uploads this new standardised revision of the submitted data (D<sup>s</sup>),
links it to the version of the submitted data from which it was derived (B),
links it to the latest version of the standard data dictionary, and enters a
log message describing the transformation she performed. </p>

<p>The assigned curator reviews her corrected standardised revision of the
submitted data (D<sup>s</sup>) with respect to the latest version of the
appropriate data release criteria, and asserts that the release criteria have
been met. </p>

<p>The submitter sees that her initial version of the submitted data (A) has
undergone one curation revision (B, derived from A), one standardisation
revision (C<sup>s</sup>, derived from B), a second standardisation revision
(D<sup>s</sup>, derived from B), and has been approved for release to <i>The
WWARN Application</i>. </p>

<h4>3.2.9. <a
name="Use_Case:_Non-Standard_Submission,_Curation_After_Standardisatio"></a>Use
Case: Non-Standard Submission, Curation After Standardisation (1)</h4>

<p>A submitter requests gatekeeper review for a new submission with a new data
dictionary. The data dictionary is not one of the WWARN standard data
dictionaries. A gatekeeper accepts the submission and assigns a curator. </p>

<p>The assigned curator downloads the initial version of the submitted data
(A), reviews it, and decides that there are some problems, but that they will
be easier to deal with after the submission has been standardised. She creates
a new data file (B<sup>s</sup>) conforming to the appropriate standard data
dictionary, uploads it, links it to the version of the submitted data from
which it was derived (A), links it to the latest version of the standard data
dictionary, and enters a log message describing the transformation she
performed. </p>

<p>The assigned curator then creates a new revision (C<sup>s</sup>), derived
from her standardised revision (B<sup>s</sup>), fixing the problems she
identified earlier. She approves this new version (C<sup>s</sup>) for release.
</p>

<p>The submitter sees that her initial version of the submitted data (A) has
undergone one standardisation revision (B<sup>s</sup>, derived from A), one
curation revision (C<sup>s</sup>, derived from B<sup>s</sup>), and has been
approved for release to <i>The WWARN Application</i>. </p>

<h4>3.2.10. <a
name="Use_Case:_Non-Standard_Submission,_Curation_After_Standardisatio"></a>Use
Case: Non-Standard Submission, Curation After Standardisation (2)</h4>

<p>A submitter requests gatekeeper review for a new submission with a new data
dictionary. The data dictionary is not one of the WWARN standard data
dictionaries. A gatekeeper accepts the submission and assigns a curator. </p>

<p>The assigned curator downloads the initial version of the submitted data
(A), reviews it, and decides to map the file onto the appropriate standard data
dictionary. She creates a new data file (B<sup>s</sup>), uploads it, links it
to the version of the submitted data from which it was derived (A), links it to
the latest version of the standard data dictionary, and enters a log message
describing the transformation she performed. </p>

<p>The assigned curator then reviews her standardised revision (B<sup>s</sup>)
and finds some problems. She decides that the problems are best fixed by going
back to the initial, non-standard version of the submitted data (A). She
creates a new, non-standard revision of the submitted data (C), uploads it,
links it to the version of the data from which it was derived (A), links it to
the appropriate version of the non-standard data dictionary, and enters a log
message. </p>

<p>The assigned curator then maps the new non-standard revision of the
submitted data (C) onto the appropriate standard data dictionary. She creates a
new data file (D<sup>s</sup>), uploads it, links it to the version of the
submitted data from which it was derived (C), links it to the latest version of
the standard data dictionary, and enters a log message describing the
transformation she performed. </p>

<p>The assigned curator then approves her latest version of the standardised
data (D<sup>s</sup>) for release. </p>

<p>The submitter sees that her initial version of the submitted data (A) has
undergone one standardisation revision (B<sup>s</sup>, derived from A), one
curation revision (C, derived from A), a second standardisation revision
(D<sup>s</sup>, derived from C), and has been approved for release to <i>The
WWARN Application</i>. </p>

<h4>3.2.11. <a name="Use_Case:_Curator_Delegation"></a>Use Case: Curator
Delegation</h4>

<p>A submitter requests gatekeeper review for a new submission with a new data
dictionary. The data dictionary is not one of the WWARN standard data
dictionaries. A gatekeeper accepts the submission and assigns a curator. </p>

<p>The assigned curator delegates the initial review of the submitted data to
another curator who specialises in quality aspects of that type of data. The
delegate curator downloads the initial version of the submitted data (A),
reviews it, decides that some rows do not meet quality control criteria,
removes them, and uploads a revised version of the submitted data (B),
notifying the assigned curator that their task is complete. </p>

<p>The assigned curator then delegates the mapping of the data onto a standard
data dictionary to a different curator, who specialises in transforming data
and data standards. The delegate curator downloads the revised version of the
submitted data (B), transforms them to conform to the latest version of the
appropriate standard data dictionary, and uploads the transformed data
(C<sup>s</sup>), notifying the assigned curator that their task is complete.
</p>

<p>The assigned curator then delegates the final review of the submission with
respect to the appropriate release criteria to third delegate curator. The
delegate approves the standardised version of the submitted data
(C<sup>s</sup>) for release. </p>

<h4>3.2.12. <a
name="Use_Case:_Coordinator_Oversight_of_Curation_and_Standardisation"></a>Use
Case: Coordinator Oversight of Curation and Standardisation Activities</h4>

<p>A coordinator reviews a list of all submissions for a given module that have
been accepted by a gatekeeper, but have not yet been approved for release. She
sees which of these have data linked to a standard data dictionary, and which
do not. From those that do not, she selects one from the list to investigate in
more detail. </p>

<p>For the selected submission, the coordinator reviews a log of all curation
and standardisation activities for that submission. She sees that several
curation revisions have been made to the submitted data, but that no
standardised revisions have yet been made. She contacts the assigned curator to
ask for more information. </p>

<h4>3.2.13. <a
name="Use_Case:_Curator_Oversight_of_Curation_&amp;_Standardisation_Ac"></a>Use
Case: Curator Oversight of Curation &amp; Standardisation Activities</h4>

<p>A curator views a list of all submissions for which she is the assigned
curator, and that have not yet been approved for release. From these, she then
views those that have not yet been mapped onto a standard data dictionary. She
selects a submission from this list, and begins working on it. </p>

<h2 id="L1824">5. Discussion &amp; Open Questions</h2>

<h3 id="L1833">5.1. Constraints on Data Dictionaries</h3>

<p>This document tentatively takes the position that, for the first major
release of Chassis/WWARN, there will be no constraints on the structure or
content of data dictionaries. Data dictionaries are simply uploaded as files of
any type, with any content. This position was taken because the complete range
of possible submitted data structures is not currently known, and therefore it
may be useful in the early stages of WWARN to enable some flexibility as the
consortium encounters new data and works towards a common approach to data
dictionaries.</p>

<p>However, the goal for later releases of Chassis/WWARN is to support a single
type of data dictionary, with the content of the data dictionary managed
through a web interface, rather than through the upload of files. Based on
previous experience in CGGH, the likely approach would be that each such data
dictionary would define a set of variables (also known as fields or
attributes), where each variable has a unique identifier, a human-readable
label, a human-readable definition of the variable's meaning, a datatype for
the variable, the units of the variable, and any range constraints (e.g.,
numeric constraints or controlled vocabulary) on the values the variable may
take. This would enable further functionality, such as an analysis of the
diversity of variable names used across all data submitted, which can support
the process of convergence on a common set of data standards across the
consortium. It would also be possible in some cases to use the data dictionary
to drive automated functionality such as simple validation of datatypes and
data ranges. It would also provide a basis for developing functionality to
define and execute mappings (i.e., transformations) between data conforming to
different data dictionaries, which is planned for future releases of
Chassis/WWARN.</p>

<p>Placing no constraints on the content or structure of data dictionaries, in
the first major release of Chassis/WWARN, may however have a number of
undesirable consequences. Firstly, many submitters may not have prior
experience of constructing data dictionaries, and may not know what information
to provide or how to provide it. Without clear guidance and examples, both the
quality (usefulness), the structure and the content of data dictionaries
created by submitters may be highly variable. Whilst prominent guidance and
examples may ameliorate some of these issues, there is no guarantee on
consistency or convergence towards a common approach to constructing data
dictionaries. Secondly, without any constraints on data dictionaries, it will
not be possible to reliably parse or analyse all data dictionaries, or to use
the data dictionary to support any automated functionality such as simple
validation of datatypes and data ranges. Thirdly, once a common approach to
data dictionaries is agreed and supported in Chassis/WWARN, there would be a
legacy of previously created dictionaries in a variety of formats to migrate,
which would require some effort.</p>

<p>Whether or not the first major release of Chassis/WWARN enforces a single
approach to data dictionaries, or is more flexible and places no constraints on
files uploaded as data dictionaries, is therefore an important open question in
this specification. </p>

<h3 id="Curation">5.2. Curation and Collaboration</h3>

<p>A design goal for the Chassis/WWARN system is that, for any submission under
curation, it is always clear who has responsibility for progressing that
submission forward. Thus, when the gatekeeper decides to accept a submission,
she also assigns a curator to the submission, and responsibility passes to the
assigned curator. The assigned curator then clearly sees which submissions she
has to work on.</p>

<p>If the assigned curator needs to work with other curators to complete the
work on a submission, there are at least two models under which they could
operate. </p>

<p>Under the sequential model, the assigned curator passes responsibility to
another curator, who completes some work on the submission, then either passes
responsibility back to the original curator or on to yet another curator. Only
one curator at any one time has ownership of the submission and can upload
revisions of the submitted data. </p>

<p>Under the parallel model, the assigned curator retains overall
responsibility for the submission, but grants permission to one or more other
curators to carry out work on the submission in parallel.</p>

<p>This begs the following questions. Which curators can view which
submissions? Which curators can upload revisions to which submissions? How do
we track who has responsibility for a submission at any given time, and how do
they pass responsibility to others?</p>

<h3 id="L1003">5.3. Other Discussion Points</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What happens if, for a given submission, the submitter uploads several
    files that are not revisions of each other, but are separate parts of a
    data set that is meant to be combined? </li>
  <li>What happens if a submitter links their submitted data to a discoverable
    data dictionary? Does the dictionary owner receive a notification, or
    request to grant access to the dictionary?</li>
