This is a list of common problems when installing and running Chassis Manta

= Details =

== Resource not found error ==

First go to /repository/service/admin/install.xql

This will show you whether the collections are installed and available - if this is the first time then you will need to install them

If you get an error message containing {{{org.cggh.chassis.manta.xquery.functions.util.config.GetJNDIVariable}}}
 then you need to check that you have a JNDI configuration either in {{{server.xml}}} and/or {{{/srv/chassis-manta/context/repository.xml}}}


Another place to check is /repository/service/admin/changehost.xql
The values in the two input boxes should be the same.
