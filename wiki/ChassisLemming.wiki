== Ideas / Wishlist ==

Not all of these are necessarily a good idea. In no particular order...

=== Editing; Validation; Constraints ===

  * duplicate a row, i.e., create a new row by copying an existing row

  * auto-incrementing columns?

  * UUID-like generated ID column (not editable for obvious reasons)?
 
  * constrain a column to contain unique values (i.e., no duplicates)

  * express logical constraints across multiple colums, e.g., birth date must be before admission date

  * get specific validation error messages, e.g., "not a valid integer", instead of nonspecific "the data are not valid"

  * get a validation report for a whole table, i.e., a summary of all validation problems

  * constrain decimal precision

  * add other datatypes, e.g., URI, email, float, double, ...?

  * ...

=== Import/Export ===

  * create a new table by importing a CSV file with configurable parser (i.e., can configure cell & row delimiters etc.)

  * create a new table by importing an Excel file

  * create a new table by importing a stata file

  * create a new table by importing an spss file

  * export a table to XML (trivial)

  * export a table to CSV

  * export a table to Excel

  * export a table to stata file

  * export a table to spss file

=== Versioning ===

  * view a diff between two specified revisions

  * export a diff or change set between two specified revisions

  * revert to specified version

=== Controlled Value Lists; Referencing Tables ===

  * provide a means to manage controlled value lists (i.e., controlled vocabularies) independently from a single table, then use the list in any number of tables

  * N.B. one way to achieve this would be to simply allow the use of one table as a value list for a column in another table

  * referential integrity and foreign keys??? effectively the same as the idea above; could use autocomplete to deal with selecting item from large tables instead of select1

=== Permissions & Authorization ===

  * provide permissions management utility for tables

=== Viewing; Searching and Query ===

  * show/hide specific columns

  * deal with tables with many columns

  * allow custom queries to filter rows of a table, e.g., show rows where age is greater than 4 and sex is male

=== Views; Mapping and Transformation ===

  * allow definition of views of a table, i.e., effectively a transformation of a table from one set of columns to another, evaluated dynamically

  * allow materialisation of a view as a new table, i.e., definition of a transformation from one set of columns to another, and store output of transformation, with derivation, and allow further editing or other work on the new table

  * allow in situ transformation/replacement of a single column of a table, e.g., transform all ages from years to months

  * define a transformation from two or more input tables to two or more output tables

=== Merging ===

  * merging of two tables, joined on a specified column, then present a report on conflicts and guide user in resolving conflicts; storing output as a new table, with derivation

  * merging in the case of longitudinal data...?

  * merging and location data with missingness...?

=== Grouping ===

  * grouping of two or more tables into database/dataset/...

=== Misc ===
 
  * defining pivot tables

  * performing simple statistical tests
