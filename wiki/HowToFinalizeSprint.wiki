Tagging the source control system

deploying the artifacts. 

*Immediately* after the version is released the version number is incremented to 
the next version with the addition of (*-SNAPSHOT*)


= Notes = 

A non-SNAPSHOT build should not depend upon any SNAPSHOT artifacts.

Beta versions imply no guarantee that the API will not change. 

All the artifacts inherit their version fro a single parent pom to enable easy maintenance of the above mechanism.
