#summary notes on systems supporting various aspects of user management, including user self-registration, authentication, and access-management

= Requirements =

WWARN needs site visitors who are potential data submitters to be able to register as a new user (i.e., create a user account), then log in (authenticate) and proceed to the submitter home page and begin submitting data.

The registration process must present as few delays or obstacles to the potential submitter as possible, so as not to put the busy submitter off.

The self-registration and login process must be exclusively WWARN-branded.

The self-registration process will need to capture some information about the user. Exactly what TBD, but will probably include institution/affiliation and contact details.

The registration process should verify the user's email address, so that WWARN has a verified means of contact, and also so that the email address can be used as part of verifying the user's identity (e.g., as a WHO employee).

Once authenticated, the user should only have to sign-in once across any part of the wwarn.org website, which could involve spanning multiple web applications potentially hosted in separate servlet containers on separate servers.

The self-registered user will be able to submit data by default, but it must be possible to revoke that right for spam/junk/bogus submitters.

The self-registration system must not be vulnerable to robots.

= Survey of Existing Solutions =

== CGGH Network Database / Webauth ==

The CGGH network database and webauth system supports single-sign-on and management of user roles. 

There is existing code to enable user self-registration, which involves the user providing an email address, and then the system sending a temporary password to that email address, which the user can then use to log in once, but must change that password on first log in. 

The system also allows the user to record some basic profile information, which includes ... ? It may not be straightforward to extend the system to capture other user information.

There is not (re)captcha support, but adding that shouldn't be too much work. 

David B reckons setting up a separate clone of the CGGH network user database and webauth system dedicated to WWARN should take less than a week of work. A clone of the system would enable all registration, login pages etc. to be wwarn-branded.
