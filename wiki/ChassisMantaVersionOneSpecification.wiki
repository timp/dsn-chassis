Note that all new users will automatically be given the _contributor_ role, i.e., once the user has registered, they can immediately begin contributing data.

Once the user is logged in, they navigate to their contributor home page, which is part of Chassis. The page contains a link to register a new study, and list of the user's registered studies, which in this case will be empty.
