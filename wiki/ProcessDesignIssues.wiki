== Use Cases ==

Roles:

  * submitter - person who provides the data
  * curator - person who works on the data to meet quality control criteria
  * standardiser - 

Notational conventions:

  * letters _A_, _B_, _C_, etc., denote some data, not in a standard form
  * letters A', B', C', etc., denote some data in a standard form
  * A -> B denotes that B was derived from A

=== Use Case 1 (Regular, Linear) ===

A submitter submits A. A curator works on A, e.g. removes some rows, or changes some columns, and creates B. A standardiser transforms B into C'.

This is the regular, linear case, where submission leads to curation, which leads to standardisation.

==== Sequence of Events ====

  # submitter:       -> A
  # curator:       A -> B
  # standardiser:  B -> C'
  
==== Derivation Graph ====

A -> B -> C'

=== Use Case 2 (Goofy, Linear) ===

==== Sequence of Events ====

  # submitter:      -> A
  # standardiser: A -> B'
  # curator:      B'-> C'
  
==== Derivation Graph ====

A -> B'-> C'

=== Use Case 3 (Goofy, Linear, Pre-Standardised) ===

==== Sequence of Events ====

  # submitter:   -> A'
  # curator:   A'-> B'
  
==== Derivation Graph ====

A'-> B'
