== Preamble ==

=== Roles ===

  * *submitter* - creates the data
  * *curator* - works on the data to meet quality control criteria
  * *standardiser* - transforms data into a standard form
  
N.B. the same person might be both curator and standardiser.

=== Notational Conventions ===

  * letters _A_, _B_, _C_, etc., denote some data, not in a standard form
  * letters _A'_, _B'_, _C'_, etc., denote some data in a standard form
  * _A_ -> _B_ denotes that _B_ was derived from _A_
  * ignore any colouring in the derivation graph ascii art, it's accidental

== Use Case 1 (Regular, Linear) ==

=== Sequence of Events ===

  # -> _A_ (submission)
  # _A_ -> _B_ (curation)
  # _B_ -> _C'_ (standardisation)
  
=== Derivation Graph ===

{{{
A -> B -> C'
}}}

=== Notes ===

This is a *regular*, *linear* case, where submission leads to curation, which leads to standardisation.

== Use Case 2 (Goofy, Linear) ==

=== Sequence of Events ===

  # -> _A_ (submission)
  # _A_ -> _B'_ (standardisation)
  # _B'_-> _C'_ (curation)
  
=== Derivation Graph ===

{{{
A -> B'-> C'
}}}

=== Notes ===

This is a "*goofy*", *linear* case, where some curation occurs after standardisation.

== Use Case 3 (Goofy, Linear, Pre-Standardised) ==

=== Sequence of Events ===

  # _A'_-> _B'_ (curation)
  
=== Derivation Graph ===

{{{
A'-> B'
}}}

=== Notes ===

This is a "*goofy*", *linear* case, where some curation occurs after standardisation, and where the data comes "pre-standardised".

== Use Case 4 (Regular, Branched) ==

=== Sequence of Events ===

  # -> _A_ (submission)
  # _A_ -> _B_ (curation)
  # _B_ -> _C'_ (standardisation)
  # _B_ -> _D_ (curation)
  # _D_ -> _E'_ (standardisation)
  
=== Derivation Graph ===

{{{
A -> B -> C'
     |
     v
     D -> E'
}}}

=== Notes ===

This is a *regular* case, where curation always precedes standardisation, with a *branch* in the derivation graph caused by two standardisation events.

== Use Case 5 (Regular, Submitter Revision) ==

=== Sequence of Events ===

  # -> _A_ (submission)
  # _A_ -> _B_ (curation)
  # _B_ -> _C'_ (standardisation)
  # _A_ -> _D_ (revised submission)
  # _D_ -> _E_ (curation)
  # _E_ -> _F'_ (standardisation)
  
=== Derivation Graph ===

{{{
A -> B -> C'
|
v
D -> E -> F'
}}}

=== Notes ===

This is a *regular* case, where curation always precedes standardisation, with a *branch* in the derivation graph caused by the submitter's revised submission.

== Use Case 6 (Branched, With a Switch) ==

=== Sequence of Events ===

  # -> _A_ (submission)
  # _A_ -> _B_ (curation)
  # _B_ -> _C'_ (standardisation)
  # _B_ -> _D_ (curation)
  # _D_ -> _E'_ (standardisation)
  # _E'_ -> _F'_ (curation)
  
=== Derivation Graph ===

{{{
A -> B -> C'
     |
     v
     D -> E'-> F'
}}}

=== Notes ===

This case has a *switch* between *regular* and *goofy*, i.e., where curation precedes standardisation in some parts of the derivation graph but not in others, with a *branch* in the derivation graph.

== Use Case 7 (Regular, Branched, Multi-Standardisation) ==

=== Sequence of Events ===

  # -> _A_ (submission)
  # _A_ -> _B_ (curation)
  # _B_ -> _C'_ (standardisation)
  # _B_ -> _D_ (curation)
  # _B_ -> _E'_ (standardisation)

=== Derivation Graph ===

{{{
A -> B -> C'
     |
     +--> E'
     |
     v
     D
}}}

=== Notes ===

This is a *regular* case, where two different standardisation transformations are applied to the same input.
