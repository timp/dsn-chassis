== Use Cases ==

Roles:

  * submitter - creates the data
  * curator - works on the data to meet quality control criteria
  * standardiser - transforms data into a standard form
  
N.B. the same person might be both curator and standardiser.

Notational conventions:

  * letters _A_, _B_, _C_, etc., denote some data, not in a standard form
  * letters _A'_, _B'_, _C'_, etc., denote some data in a standard form
  * _A_ -> _B_ denotes that _B_ was derived from _A_

=== Use Case 1 (Regular, Linear) ===

A submitter creates _A_. A curator works on _A_ (e.g., removes some rows, or changes some columns) and creates _B_. A standardiser transforms _B_ into _C'_.

This is the regular, linear case, where submission leads to curation, which leads to standardisation.

==== Sequence of Events ====

  # _A_ -> _B_ (curation)
  # _B_ -> _C'_ (standardisation)
  
==== Derivation Graph ====

_A_ -> _B_ -> _C'_

=== Use Case 2 (Goofy, Linear) ===

A submitter creates _A_. A standardiser transforms _A_ into _B'_. A curator then works on _B'_ (e.g., removes some rows, but does not change the structure of the data) and creates _C'_.

This is the "goofy", linear case, where some curation occurs after standardisation.

==== Sequence of Events ====

  # _A_ -> _B'_ (standardisation)
  # _B'_-> _C'_ (curation)
  
==== Derivation Graph ====

_A_ -> _B'_-> _C'_

=== Use Case 3 (Goofy, Linear, Pre-Standardised) ===

A submitter creates _A'_ which is already in a standard form (e.g., the WHO spreadsheet format). A curator works on _A'_ and creates _B'_.

This is the "goofy" case, where some curation occurs after standardisation, and where the data comes "pre-standardised".

==== Sequence of Events ====

  # _A'_-> _B'_ (curation)
  
==== Derivation Graph ====

_A'_-> _B'_
