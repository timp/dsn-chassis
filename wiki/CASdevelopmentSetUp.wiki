  * Checkout wwarn-cas
  * Create the database using the script in resources/min-db.sql
  * Follow the instructions for configuring tomcat datasources
  * Configure Apache

== Apache Configuration ==

1. Set up apache2 to reverse proxy cas through SSL:

{{{
a2ensite default-ssl
a2enmod ssl
}}}

2. Modify the default-ssl file and add the the following lines to the end of the file, inside the VirtualHost section:

{{{
        ProxyRequests Off
        <Proxy *>
                Order deny,allow
                Allow from all
        </Proxy>
}}} 
        ProxyPass /sso http://localhost:8080/sso
        ProxyPassReverse /sso http://localhost:8080/sso
        ProxyPass /repository http://localhost:8080/repository
        ProxyPassReverse /repository http://localhost:8080/repository

3. Import the self-signed ssl certificate into the cacerts file for the jvm on the local machine. This will tell java that the local machine is a valid ssl cert issuing authority as far a java is concerned. The ubuntu package for apache2 generates the self-signed certificate when you install it. We can find the one that is being used by apache by looking in the /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl configuration file:

{{{
        SSLCertificateFile    /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
}}}

Note that we need to set up the host for proper usage of SSL. We need to include the IP address in /etc/hosts like so:

{{{
127.0.0.1 localhost
10.204.241.226 cloud1.cggh.org cloud1 # real IP
174.129.200.39 cloud1.cggh.org cloud1 # elastic IP
}}}

add the correct host name to the /etc/hostname file:

{{{
cloud1
}}}

Restart the machine to make sure these changes are applied.

4. Add a NameVirtualHost and change the VirtualHost record to reflect the physical IP of the machine in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl:

{{{
#<VirtualHost _default_:443>
NameVirtualHost 10.204.241.226:443
<VirtualHost 10.204.241.226:443>
}}}

5. Replace the self-signed SSL certificate to reflect the hostname changes:

{{{
make-ssl-cert generate-default-snakeoil --force-overwrite
}}}

6. Import this into the java cacerts file.

{{{
cd /etc/ssl/certs/java
cp cacerts cacerts.orig
keytool -import -file /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem -keystore ./cacerts
}}}
