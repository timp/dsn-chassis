#summary instructions for finishing up a sprint by svn tagging, building and packaging the Chassis projects

= SVN Tagging =

Before carrying out an end-of-sprint build and package of the Chassis source code projects, the first step is to create SVN version tags to record the state of the source.

The tag name convention is to create a version identifier, e.g. `0.1-alpha-2`, and use this as the base for a tag name for each source code project.

E.g., for the `0.1-alpha-2` version, the projects at 

{{{
trunk/generic/client/gwt
trunk/generic/lib/gwt
trunk/generic/lib/java
trunk/generic/service/user
trunk/generic/service/exist
}}}

should get copied to

{{{
tags/0.1-alpha-2/generic/client/gwt
tags/0.1-alpha-2/generic/lib/gwt
tags/0.1-alpha-2/generic/lib/java
tags/0.1-alpha-2/generic/service/user
tags/0.1-alpha-2/generic/service/exist
}}}

respectively.

Version identifiers, e.g., `0.1-alpha-2` or `0.1-beta-5` or `0.1-RC-3` or `0.1-final` are constructed using (release number)-(development stage)-(iteration number within development stage). For development stages, "alpha" means not feature complete, "beta" means feature complete but not thoroughly tested, "RC" means release candidate, "final" means the version actually released.
