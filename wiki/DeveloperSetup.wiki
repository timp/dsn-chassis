#summary Tricks and gotchas during developer setup
= Introduction =

Whilst you can setup your system as per MantaConfiguration  
this  will rely upon using 
{{{
mvn install tomcat:redeploy 
}}}
to make changes visible. 

For a shorter edit/compile/view cycle setup tomcat 'inside ' eclipse.

Follow instructions here:

This makes a copy of your tomcat installation.

There are however a couple of gotchas: 
the manager application does not appear to get copied, so you can no longer use the tomcat deployer. 
The context defined in {{{/srv/chassis-manta/context/repository.xml}}} is ignored, so you need to add its contents to the {{{server.xml}}} copied into eclipse. 


== Resource not found error ==

First go to /repository/service/admin/install.xql

This will show you whether the collections are installed and available - if this is the first time then you will need to install them

If you get an error message containing {{{org.cggh.chassis.manta.xquery.functions.util.config.GetJNDIVariable}}}
 then you need to check that you have a JNDI configuration either in {{{server.xml}}} and/or {{{/srv/chassis-manta/context/repository.xml}}}


Another place to check is /repository/service/admin/changehost.xql
The values in the two input boxes should be the same.

If you delete the data set then remember to recreate the config collection: 

= Initialise config collection =
  # [http://localhost:8080/repository/administration/home AdminHome]
  # [http://localhost:8080/repository/service/admin/update-1.1-1.2/index.xhtml update-1.1-1.2]
  # [http://localhost:8080/repository/service/admin/init-config.xql init config]
