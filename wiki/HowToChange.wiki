#summary A description of how to make changes to the Chassis data model


= Details =

== Define the XML change you want to make ==

It's a good idea (although not strictly necessary) to start by changing the XML schema held in the chassis-model project. The advantage of starting here is that it will help ensure that your change fits nicely within the schema e.g. not reusing a previously used element name. You'll need to do this later anyway.

== Start with an empty database ==

Delete the contents of your exist data directory - the files will be recreated when you restart the application.

Don't forget to recreate the collections via the developer home page and repopulate the config collection from the admin page.

== Change the new study template ==

In src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/resources/apps/common/templates/study add your new element(s)

== Change the input form ==

This will probably be in src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/resources/apps/common/templates/includes/study

Copy an example of a similar field

If you need validation e.g. number only field then you'll need to change the schema in src/main/webapp/insecure/schema

For a drop down the values are also held as enumerations in the schema - the labels are in src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/resources/apps/common/resources.xml - you can read the wiki page on how this works or just copy an example.

Field labels are sometimes text strings, sometimes in resources.xml - they should be in resources.xml but haven't yet all been moved.

More complex things such as displaying the other text input field when the other drop option is selected are controlled via the bindings in src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/resources/apps/common/templates/includes/study/study-info-bindings.xml
