#summary some notes on issues relevant to data protection

= Workflow =

I've assumed that, as a bare minimum, the following will apply.

*Who Are Submitters?*

We antipate the following people will be submitting data to WWARN:

  * researchers from scientific and/or academic institutions
  * members of public health organisations such as WHO or national malaria control programs
  * ...?

*Self-Registration*

A potential data submitter will first create a new user account on the wwarn.org web site. This account creation process is also known here as self-registration.

*Information Collected During Self-Registration*

Self-registration will involve filling in a form on a web page, and providing at least their first and last name, their chosen user name, a valid email address, and the name of an instution or organisation with which they are affiliated.

Additional information may also be collected via the self-registration form, however, the nature of this information is yet to be decided by WWARN. Some information will probably be required by the communications team, for example, additional contact details.

*Account Activation*

Once the user has submitted the self-registration form, an email will be automatically sent to the address they provided. This email address will contain a URL which they can visit to activate their new user account. When they visit the activation URL in their web browser, the new user will be asked to provide a password, which they can subsequently use to authenticate themselves (i.e., log in) to secure areas of the wwarn.org site.

*Log In*

Once the new user has activated their account, they can then use their username and password to log in to the wwarn.org site via a secure (HTTPS) connection.

*Online Data Submission*

A logged in user will be able to submit data to WWARN. They will not require any additional confirmation or authorisation before becoming a submitter, they will automatically be given the submitter authorisation role when their account is activated.

Once logged in, the submitter will be able to begin the web-based data submission process. This process guides the user through a sequence of four web pages. 

At the first step the submitter selects the study for which they would like to submit data, or creates a new study if they have not previously done so, providing a title for the study, and the list of other users (if any) who are authorised to submit data for that study.

At the second step the user uploads one or more files from their computer. This should include at least one data file, but may also include other files such as data dictionaries and protocol descriptions.

At the third step the submitter is asked to read the WWARN data sharing agreement, and to indicate whether or not they accept the terms of the agreement. The text of this agreement is to be determined.

At the final step the submitter is asked to fill out the study questionnaire, providing addiotional information about various aspects of the study, such as details of the protocols and methods used.

*Storage of Uploaded Files*

All reasonable measures will be taken to ensure that the servers on which the uploaded files are stored are secured, and that no unauthorised parties may gain access to the files. This will include limiting access to the servers to authorised systems administrators using public key authentication, and encrypting all potentially sensitive communication to and from these secured servers.

*Curation of Submitted Data Files*

WWARN will authorise one or more people to act as curators for submitted data files. Curators are required because submitted data files may come in a wide variety of formats and structures, and these must be standardised and quality controlled before they can be submitted for analysis.

Currently it is assumed that the scientific coordinators for each module will act as curators. These are Patrice Piola (located in Oxford), Carole Mackosso (located in Paris), Lesley Workman (located in Johannesburg) and Meera Venkatesan (located in Washington).

Each of these curators will themselves have a registered user account with wwarn.org, and will be able to login with a username and password.

Each of these curators will addionally be assigned the curator role, which will enable them to access curator-only secure areas of wwarn.org, from where they can view submissions that have been made and download any of the files that have been submitted to their local computer to begin their curation work.

*Upload of Curated Files*

In the course of their work the curators will create new files containing transformed or otherwise edited version of the data files originally submitted. They will periodically upload these files to the secure curator area of wwarn.org, in order to create an audit trail for the work they have done. 

The servers on which the curators uploaded files are stored will be subject to the same security constraints as the servers on which the submitters' initially uploaded files are (these will very likely be the same servers). 

*Anonymisation and Directly Personally Identifiable Information*

WWARN will not require any directly personally identifiable information regarding the subjects of the research studies from which data is being submitted. I.e., the data files submitted to WWARN do not need to contain names of study subjects or any other directly personally identifiable information. 

It has been suggested that WWARN makes it clear to potential submitters via appropriate notices on the wwarn.org web pages that submitted data should be cleansed of any directly personally identifiable information such as person names. I.e., data should be anonymised prior to submission.

However, even if this is made clear, it is still a risk that submitters might submit data files containing directly personally identifiable information.

How WWARN deals with this risk has not been formally decided. However, it has been suggested that, before the curation process begins, a distinct anonymisation process is carried out, whereby all submitted files are first checked to see if they contain any personally identifiable information, and if they do, to carry out the work of anonymising the files.  

If this is decided, then one or people will be authorised to carry out the checking and anonymisation work. These people may or may not be drawn from the set of authorised curators. These people will, in the course of their checking and anonymisation work, log in to a secure and restricted area of wwarn.org, and download submitted files to their local computer, where they will open and check the file for personal data. If personal data is found, they would record the fact that the file contains personal data via the website, and then create and upload an anonymised version of the file to the website. If personal data is not found, the file will be marked as safe, again via the website.

The curators would then only be authorised to download and begin work on data files once they have been checked for personal data and either marked as safe or anonymised.

*Retention of Files Known to Contain Directly Personally Identifiable Information*

It has been suggested that, even where files are found to contain directly personally identifiable information, these files are not deleted from the secure wwarn.org servers. The argument for retaining this information, even tho it is not required to carry out the scientific analyses, is that these files represent the starting point of the curation process. If problems are found in the data during downstream analyses, the curators may wish to retrace their steps all the way back to the source data, to ensure that no mistakes were made during anonymisation or curation.

*Use of Indirectly Personally Identifiable Information*

Although WWARN will not require directly identifiable data such as person names, they will require other data such as sex, age/dob and location, as a key element of their scientific analyses, which in some circumstances could qualify as personally identifiable information. 

Therefore it seems likely that, in the general case, WWARN's usual business of curating and analysing data will qualify as processing of personal data, even if directly personally identifiable data is removed by an anonymisation process. 

*Sensitive Personal Data*

Some of the data that WWARN expects to recieve will be data concerning clinical events in study subjects. It is possible that these data, which are required for anticipated analyses, could consititute sensiutive personal data, however this would bear closer inspection.

*Analysis and Ouputs of Curated Data*

For each study for which data files are submitted, those data files will be curated into a standard format by the WWARN curators as described above.  

Once curated, the data will then be used as inputs to various analysis procedures, from which will be generated various outputs, such as graphs, tables and reports.

Some of these outputs will be generated from data from a single study only. Other outputs will be generated from analysis of data aggregated from multiple studies. 

Some of these outputs will be made publicly available via wwarn.org. It is assumed that any outputs which are made publicly available will contain only summarised information which could not be used in any way to idenfify the subjects of the origin study or studies.

Some of these outputs will not be made publicly available, but will be made available only to the people who submitted the data that formed the basis for those outputs. Whether some of these outputs might contain indirectly personally identifiable information has not been considered afaik.

*Dialogue With Submitters*

It is expected that in the normal course of business WWARN will want to contact people who have registered user accounts. For example, curators may need to contact a submitter to discuss technical aspects of a submitted data file.

To enable this, at least the curators and other as yet unspecified people will require access to contact information for registered wwarn.org users.

*Clarification - Two Classes of Personal Data*

In case it is not clear from the above, there are two distinct classes of personal data which WWARN will have to consider w.r.t data protection. 

The first class of personal data is the data collected from users of the wwarn.org site during the self-registration process, which is likely to include names, email addresses and other contact information. The majority of these registered users will be submitters.

The second class of personal data is data concerning the subjects of research studies, which may be contained in data files submitted to WWARN.

*Business Not Mediated via wwarn.org*

In discussion PG has suggested that WWARN regional representatives might work directly with potential data submitters prior to their interacting with the wwarn.org site and submitting data via the online submission system.

The exact nature and scope of these direct interaction has yet to be determined, and is not considered here.
