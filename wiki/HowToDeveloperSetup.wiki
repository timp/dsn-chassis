#summary how to set up the standard development environment for working with the Chassis source code

= Introduction =

This page is a guide to setting up the standard development environment used by the Chassis team. Examples are given for Linux (Ubuntu Jaunty), but can be adapted for Windows.

== Install Java 1.5 ==

The standard compiler level for Chassis source code is Java 1.5. 

Java 1.5 is also the standard used to run Chassis in the development environment. Java 6 may work, but some issues have been found with Java 6 and GWT on Linux.

sudo apt-get install sun-java5-jdk

== Install Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers ==

Visit [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ eclipse.org downloads] and download the the Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers, based on *Eclipse 3.5 (Galileo)*, for your platform. Install it at your preferred location. 

== Install the Google Plugin for Eclipse ==

Install the [http://code.google.com/eclipse/docs/getting_started.html Google Plugin for Eclipse 3.5 (Galileo)] via the following update site URL:

  * http://dl.google.com/eclipse/plugin/3.5

You'll need the plugin and the web toolkit SDK.

== Install SVN Plugin (Subversive) for Eclipse ==

Install the Subversive SVN Team Provider for Eclipse 3.5. This takes two steps.

First, from "Help -> Install New Software", choose the Galileo site (already added), expand the "Collaboration" section, and select "Subversive SVN Team Provider (Incubation". Continue through to install.

Second, from "Help -> Install New Software", add a new update site with the following URL:

  * http://www.polarion.org/projects/subversive/download/eclipse/2.0/update-site/

From there, select "SVNKit 1.3.0 Implementation (Optional)" and continue through to install.

(These instructions are also written up with screenshots [http://benjchristensen.com/2009/06/24/eclipse-galileo-3-5-and-subversion/ here].)

== Check Out Chassis Source Code Projects ==

First, ask one of the [http://dsn-chassis.googlecode.com Chassis project] owners to be added as a project committer.

Switch to perspective "SVN Repository Exploring", click on the "New Repository Location" button, set the URL as:

  * https://dsn-chassis.googlecode.com/svn

...and enter your Google Code user name and password (if you don't know your googlecode.com password, visit http://code.google.com/hosting/settings).

Check out projects from the following SVN locations:

  * /trunk/generic/lib/java
  * /trunk/generic/lib/gwt
  * /trunk/generic/client/gwt
  * /trunk/generic/service/user
  * /branches/generic/service/exist-1.4.0rc-rev10028

(If you browse to the location in the SVN repositories view, then right click on the location, you can do "Check Out" from there.)

== Install Apache Tomcat 6.0 ==
