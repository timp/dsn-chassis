Milestone: Chassis/WWARN submission system limited release (by invitation) 

  * Task: final draft of study questionnaire

Milestone: Chassis/WWARN submission system public release (mid April)

Milestone: Chassis/WWARN minimal submitted data access system (including anonymisation support?) - enables curators to get access to submissions

---- begin ad hoc work to update data in wwarn explorer preview version using submissions received -- this continues in parallel to work below developing wwarn explorer version 1 and curation process with audit trail, to give impression that wwarn is accepting data and doing something with it ----

  * Task: get final agreement on data dictionary

Milestone: Patrice Mapper version 1

Milestone: Chassis/WWARN curation system version 1 (production release) 

Milestone: completed re-submission, curation and analysis of all existing datasets

Milestone: WWARN explorer version 1 (integrated with Chassis/WWARN, containing only curated data with audit trail)

  * Task: agree outputs (graphs, statistics) to go into explorer version 1

---- retire wwarn explorer prototype version, end ad hoc updates to wwarn explorer prototype version ----

WWARN explorer version 1 is minimally sufficient if it has all the same features (i.e., outputs) that are present in the preview release. 

I.e., WWARN explorer version 1 is sufficient if it looks pretty much exactly the same as the preview version. All the work we are doing up to version 1 is behind the scenes, on the back-end systems, processes, and of course the data.

Of course, if possible, we MAY add new outputs to the WWARN explorer version 1, but it's *not* a necessity.

WWARN explorer version 1 must be deployed before the end of 2010.
