Milestone: WWARN explorer preview version (limited release, by invitation)

  * Task: final comments and change requests from modules (deadline: midnight 25 March)
  * Task: check that for each study, place, year, number of patients, output in acceptable range
  * Task: fix any problems found in task above
  * Task: check that outputs are scientifically correct and valid
  * Task: testing for bugs in user-interface
  * Task: performance & load testing
  * Task: modules make final decision on features

Milestone: WWARN explorer preview version (public release) (April 8/9)

Milestone: Chassis/WWARN submission system limited release (by invitation) 

  * Task: final draft of study questionnaire (26 March)

Milestone: Chassis/WWARN submission system public release (mid April)

Milestone: Chassis/WWARN minimal submitted data access system (including anonymisation support?) - enables curators to get access to submissions

---- begin ad hoc work to update data in wwarn explorer preview version using submissions received -- this continues in parallel to work below developing wwarn explorer version 1 and curation process with audit trail, to give impression that wwarn is accepting data and doing something with it ----

Milestone: Modules nominate which datasets will be submitted and curated and expect to appear in wwarn explorer version 1 (these will be used for trial submission/curation activity).

Milestone: Chassis/WWARN curation system prototype version (deadline: June 1)

Milestone: agree WWARN standard file format prototype version (deadline: March 31)

  * Task: review and agree wwarn standard data dictionary component for prototype version of format

Milestone: Patrice Mapper prototype version (done)

  * Task: Patrice walk through with Lesley, Meera, Carole...

Milestone: Modules define data quality checks during curation process (e.g., logical inconsistencies), i.e., tests that a dataset must *pass* in order to be allowed to go into the WWARN explorer

Milestone: Modules define plan of analysis

Milestone: completed trial submission/curation and analysis activity with chassis(+mapper?) and sample of existing datasets (deadline: June 31)

---- checkpoint: outcome of trial curation activity? ----

(Deadlines for further work depend on outcome of trial curation activity.)

Milestone: finalise WWARN standard file format version 1 (deadline: ASAP)

  * Task: get final agreement on data dictionary

Milestone: Patrice Mapper version 1 (deadline: ASAP)

Milestone: Modules lock down definition of data quality checks version 1

Milestone: Modules lock down plan of analysis & outputs expected in wwarn explorer version 1

Milestone: Chassis/WWARN curation system version 1 (production release) (deadline: ASAP)

Milestone: completed re-submission, curation and analysis of all existing datasets (deadline: ASAP)

Milestone: WWARN explorer version 1 (integrated with Chassis/WWARN, containing only curated data with audit trail) (deadline: ASAP)

  * Task: agree outputs (graphs, statistics) to go into explorer version 1

---- retire wwarn explorer prototype version, end ad hoc updates to wwarn explorer prototype version ----

WWARN explorer version 1 is minimally sufficient if it has all the same features (i.e., outputs) that are present in the preview release. 

I.e., WWARN explorer version 1 is sufficient if it looks pretty much exactly the same as the preview version. All the work we are doing up to version 1 is behind the scenes, on the back-end systems, processes, and of course the data.

Of course, if possible, we MAY add new outputs to the WWARN explorer version 1 (and will try as hard as we can) but it's *not* a necessity.

WWARN explorer version 1 must be deployed before the end of 2010.
