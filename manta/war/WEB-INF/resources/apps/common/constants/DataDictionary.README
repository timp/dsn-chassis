This Directory contains the Data Dictionary for the system. 

Each file contains the values which an element may take. 

A note as to whether the value set may be extended should be placed in a comment. 
The open sets will include a term such as 'Other' and will be housed in file with a name ending in '-terms'.

All label values are in English, these will need to be duplicated in other languages.
