	<p>You have control over who can access your studies. To share a study with an individual, you will need to add them as an administrator. Administrators will have all the same rights as you — the study creator — including uploading data, downloading anonymized data, adding/removing administrators and editing the study information. Administrators will only be able to access the study once it has been registered and will need to register with the WWARN website.
	</p>
	
	<p>You can add or remove administrators at any time by logging into your account, navigating to this study and clicking the Permissions tab.
